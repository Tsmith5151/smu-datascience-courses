But I started to have my suspicions about TS4 when visiting Disneyland recently, when I saw the pre-release merchandising of the Bo Peep and Forky characters. Wow, what kid is going to warm up to a spork (other than Bonnie?). After seeing the film, I can only conclude that TS4's primary goal is simple; sell more stuff. Very pale when compared to the previous ones, the supporting characters are now mere afterthoughts, Buzz has been dumbed down (weak batteries, perhaps?). The rest of the gang, who all had fully developed individual personalities, have very few lines this time, seemingly only there as window dressing.

Bo Peep, however, becomes the new focus of the film. No longer shy, sweet, and demure, she's now Bo Rambo flexing her considerable physical skills with cold detachment. I have no problem with strong female leads, but at what cost to the TS story line? She's no longer the Bo we grew to know and love. Run, Woody! Run!

Ah, well. They should've stopped at TS3, and not ruined much that they achieved with the dark and disturbing ending of TS4. No longer celebrating a toy's altruistic higher calling, cynical self-interest is the new path to a happy ending.",3

We wish that we never saw this Toy Story 4. What happen to our beloved characters. In the car on the way home, I said to my kids, this movie cannot have been written by the same wonderful writers of Toy Story, Toy Story 2 and 3 . What happened to all our favorite characters (we didn't see much of them in this fourth movie ), what is that stupid ending, and why the original characters are now so very different. Why did the writers conformed to the rest of what is going on in the movie industry. Why couldn't they have stay true to what was so wonderful about Toy Story. My son (12 years old) told me at the end of the movie that he wish he never saw this Toy Story 4 so he could remember how wonderful was the ending of Toy Story 3. I feel cheated, WTF 😬 Didn't like this movie and for me Toy Story will finish at Toy Story 3. Review from a mother who saw Toy Story in cinema when first release in 1995, a true fan until this disastrous Toy Story 4. I give this movie a rating of 1 star and I am generous. Terrible ending, all our favorite characters were absent. Our strong Buzz was portrayed as dumb and clueless and for Woody, I didn't know this Woody, a totally different person. And how can Bonnie (5 years old) already ditched Woody after promising to Andy that she will love and look after Woody. I am so so sad, I don't even want to know about a possible Toy Story 6. I will pretend that this movie was never made.",1

It's hard not to tear up at the end of 3 which was the perfect ending to (arguably) Pixar's best franchise. This film completely ruins Toy Story's legacy. It didn't take long for me to realise this film wasn't going to be good and that it's only purpose was to make more money of a beloved franchise. The story is forgettable, all of the new characters are either uninteresting or underdeveloped and almost all of the original toys are dismissed and barely in the movie. This felt like a direct to dvd sequel and I'm going to pretend that it isn't the official end to the series. I'm not going to spoil the ending but all you need to know is that it's completely unsatisfying. I'll admit, I felt emotional at the end. I felt very sad. But not because the movie was moving me, I was sad because of how disappointing the ending was and that this is the official ending no matter what I think. I'd advise you to skip this movie and let Toy Story 3 be your final memory of Toy Story instead.",1

Sure it looks great and almost real but that is where the good ends. The characters you know and love are barley in the movie (besides woody), which wouldnt be a bad thing if the new characters were worth anything. The new characters get really no back story or introduction and you are just suppose to care about these characters like you do about the ones that have been around for 20 years.

The big complaint is how it ends. I wont spoil it for people who havent seen it, but it goes against everything all the other toy story movies go for (including the shorts). Sure some will say its a story about growth and change, but it completely ruins the whole franchise. They should have stopped at 3 and kept making the shorts if this is what they were going to release.",1

The resolution an animation were the only highlights. The story seemed to be written for an entirely different era. Not even 90's, this creepy depressing film was written for the early 80's but not in a cool throwback sorta way. There was almost no story or plot and they tried way too hard to get emotional to the point where one toy after another was just trying to outdo the other to see which toy had the biggest disappointing and depressing rejection and separation issues with children. Hey Pixar, here's a little refresher....it's 2019 and kids don't play with any of these toys. Sheep and skunk remote control overplayed. First time a toy was controlled in a way that is not possible and seen by people. Just bad bad bad from start to, well, I assume finish, for those die hard who actually endured to the end of this animated yawn fest. There were a few scattered laughs but they were far and few between. The old antique toys were as creepy as the Annabelle doll so I figured I might as well go into the next theater over and see the new Annabelle if I want to see a creepy doll. Don't waste time taking kids to this. They were getting fidgety and some started whining and crying by the time I left.",1

The Good: we get to see more from Woody, Buzz, and the rest with Bonnie.

The Bad: An antagonist in which the director fell into today's trappings of being someone who is misunderstood and pitied instead.

This is the first time we walked out of the theater after watching a Toy Story movie and felt disappointed and unsatisfied with what was presented.

All in all, Toy Story 4 is entirely forgettable and will be left out of our collection. They should have stopped at Toy Story 3.",3

It reels us all back into childhood and keeps our innocence alive. Toy Story has had the privilege of taking us all on that journey. Sadly, Toy Story 4 has brought our childlike innocence to a screeching halt.

Although, it really goes without saying, the toys should have never been given away to Bonnie. To keep the nostalgia alive, in Toy Story 3, Andy could have kept his toys in the attic. The ending could have shown glimpses of Andy getting married and having children. The ending of part 3 could have very easily been bittersweet to see Andy's toys given to his own children and Woody and Buzz's legacy of faithfulness to Andy's children continue.

Toy Story 4 felt like a slap in the face to not only all the fans of Toy Story, but the hope that this film brought with it. The main charachter really focuses on solely Woody, which becomes apparent by the end of the film. In no way is this taking away from the laughs the film brought, because it is quite amusing. The plot felt scattered and pointless. As an adult whom had favorite toys saved in the attic for the my children,Toy Story 4 was a huge disappointment. ""Gabby Gabby's"" character felt quite selfish. In leaving Woody in the condition that they left him in didn't feel selfless; it felt robbed of his loyalty. Although the stuffed bunny and chick were funny, their characters felt like Pixar was looking for ways to find laughs. Finding ""Bo Peep"" as a conclusion to the story was not a good enough reason to create Toy Story 4.

A sad misstep in Toy Story's legacy. Having mixed reviews from the audience in Toy Story 4 after a long love from the inception is just saddening.",1

Toy story 1 was good Toy Story2 was OK Toy story 3 well OK but this Toy story 4 shows series should end it now. This wasn't meant children under 11. People just want to relieve the past thinking what was good in the past is same now........no its not. As a parent I don't recommend the movie, Because of surreal settings that seem more gloomy and depressing than happy and cheerful. At some point I can't believe this was a Disney movie it's hard to believe it was. I feel sorry for the parents who brought their five and six-year-olds to this movie because if they did those poor kids will have nightmares right after.

The film did make incorporate a lot of nostalgic elements and over-the-top jokes that you would be sure to have a laugh and smile a bit.

But the plot itself is incoherent and not a bit faithful to the trilogy. It forcefully introduces a scene that has never been mentioned at all in the previous Toy Story films, and it drives the entire plot onwards. The ending was also abrupt, and the friendship and romantic buildup in the past 3 films seems completely ruined just within a few minutes at the end.

The ending was abrupt also because I felt like the story was supposed to continue while it suddenly came to an end. There were so, so many questions left unanswered that even should Pixar make another sequel, it will never be able to address all of them.

The message of spreading individualism and feminist-esque hints throughout the film seems to be screaming out too much at points in the film.

The individualist aspect also defeats the values of the ""Toys"", precisely every admirable act by Woody in the past seems to be meaningless and ""wrong"", simply he was not thinking for himself.",3

Toy Story 4 was disappointing, really disappointing. It was eerie, dark, and lacked all the heart of the first 3. It completely contradicts the underlying theme of the first 3 movies and throws it into a 180, leaving us with a sad, lackluster, way too ""hey, kids- reality's not easy"" ending. According to this latest installment; 1.) You don't have a friend in me. 2.) Whatever life throws at you, it's not going to be okay because you can't count on your friends & family to be there for you to infinity and beyond.

So many elements to this movie were just flat out depressing. Woody is trapped, defeated and dismembered, being robbed of his voice box and yet, we're supposed to somehow completely be ok with that because the eerie attacker is the one who the story writers want to aim sympathy toward (??!) The other horribly depressing part of this story is Buzz Lightyear is reduced to a brainless sideshow coward who has somehow lost his heroic persona. Also, Bo Peep is so cold with zero emotion!

A seriously contradictory and downright depressing ""final chapter"" to what used to be one of the finest kid movies American pop culture ever had. Completely void of charm and heart. So bad!",1

Watching this animated film as an adult, I was thinking during the first half an hour why was this even made? Why am I watching a cartoon about a pathetic looking spork made of chewing gum and why all the fuss about it? Couldn't they come up with something better in 9 years? As it went along, the story improved and at the end I did enjoy it but no way near as the previous ones.

The new toys are different from what we saw in the earlier movies and have some interesting personalities which lead to good toy-chemistry and some funny moments. The plot has some originality but at times feels repetitive with decisions being forced and characters acting inconsistent to their personalities not to mention some of them being left behind as a whole. Also, the fact that the entire plot hinges on a spork, makes it difficult to fully appreciate despite the philosophical points and messages that it sends.

I did enjoy the first 3 Toy Stories but I felt that this one fell short of its predecessors in establishing an emotional connection and leaving me with a feeling of overall wholesomeness by the end of the story which is sad because this is what Pixar has always been known for. As an adult, I would not say that this one is a must watch unless you are a die hard fan of the franchise or have children. Its good but not as phenomenal as everyone is saying.

So much to my chagrin, they have. I went in tonight with no expectations, other than the hopes that film would bookend (hopefully) what came before. I have to admit, the beginning was overly sad, almost morose, while the middle got increasingly bizarre, leading to an ending that felt, well, off. It didn't feel right. You can argue all the live-long day about why the filmmakers are brilliant in their choices, or why they did what they did with this film, but ultimately what matters is how the movie made you feel. This movie doesn't FEEL like Toy Story. It feels like an off-shoot of the series, with the characters we know (and actually sorta love) acting OUT of character. The finale is peculiar in that it didn't leave me smiling as I left the theatre like the previous three did. If I were to wager a guess, I think, perhaps, what happened here is that Pixar didn't have enough people going, hang on, are we getting this right? It's how I imagine The Last Jedi got made... too many 'yes men.' I remember reading a story where Rashida Jones left this project because of creative differences. I wonder now if she was, perhaps, the only one with the nous to stand up for what Toy Story has always been about... sticking together. The creators behind this one certainly didn't.",4

The film presented an entirely new way of telling a story, bringing characters to life via CGI - pixels over pencils, so to speak. At the same time, Toy Story set a new high standard for storytelling in film, proving conclusively that animated movies aren't just for kids. In the intervening decades, the franchise has even made a strong case in favour of sequels - demonstrating that they're not necessarily soulless cash-grabs. Toy Story 4 is very much a part of that grand tradition. This is smart, soulful, sublime film-making: somehow entertaining and profound all at once.

THE STORY: Sheriff Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) is trying his best to adjust to life with Bonnie (Madeleine McGraw) - the little girl who inherited Andy's beloved childhood toys at the end of Toy Story 3. Even though he's forgotten more often than not, Woody remains intensely focused on Bonnie and her happiness. This means going into full babysitter/bodyguard mode when Bonnie creates Forky (Tony Hale), a spork with twists of wire for hands and clumsy wooden popsicle sticks for feet. As Woody tries to keep the trash-oriented Forky safe, he's swept into an accidental adventure - one in which he meets old friends and learns new truths about who he is and who he has yet to be.

THE GREAT: Perhaps the most remarkable thing about Toy Story 4 is the fact that it feels like the natural, necessary final chapter of a story told in four parts. There's no way that any of this could have been planned when Pixar first introduced us to Woody in 1995, but the progression in both narrative and character development feels utterly organic. Woody has spent the last three films grappling with his existential fear of being lost, forgotten or replaced, from his first meeting with the brash Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) to the day Andy outgrew him and went away to college. This film challenges Woody - and his audiences - to think hard about second chances, about changing how you look at yourself, about finding and embracing a new purpose in life. As such, Toy Story 4 might be the most philosophical movie you'll see this year, in the best possible way.

THE NOT-SO-GREAT: There actually isn't all that much to complain about. The plot machinations can feel a little clunky at times, but Stephany Folsom and Andrew Stanton weave so much joy and humour into their screenplay that the film still zips along. As this is very much Woody's movie, fan-favourite legacy characters like Buzz and Jessie (Joan Cusack) inevitably end up taking a back-seat. Even then, however, they each still get moments to shine. You might find yourself both thoroughly amused and mildly annoyed by the antics of Ducky (Keagan Michael-Key) and Bunny (Jordan Peele), a symbiotic pair of new characters who were clearly inserted into proceedings for comic relief.

FORKING FUNNY: Give it up for Forky, surely the best new animated character of the year. Voiced with a bewildered tenderness by Hale, Forky is a delight - a walking, talking identity crisis created out of one little girl's love and imagination. Even better? With his magnetic attraction to all nearby trash-cans, Forky is a fandom meme just waiting to happen. A close runner-up is daredevil stuntman Duke Caboom, who reportedly owes his ridiculously charming posing and personality to current internet darling Keanu Reeves' commitment to the role. Toy Story 4 even manages to make its main antagonist, Gabby Gabby (Christina Hendricks), both terrifying and endearing - although there are fewer shades of grey when it comes to her ventriloquist-doll minions, led by the determinedly creepy Benson.

COWBOY BLUES: Ultimately, Toy Story 4 belongs to Woody, and rightfully so. He is this franchise's Captain America, in more ways than one. This film pays loving tribute to Woody's big heart and unwavering, self-effacing loyalty, even as it shakes up his life and world-view when he encounters old friend and possible paramour Bo Peep (Annie Potts) again. (Bo, by the way, is now super-cool and as far away from a fragile damsel-in-distress as anyone can be.) Woody's decisions and revelations about himself will make you weep with the most complex and bittersweet of emotions. There is joy and sorrow here, hope and heartbreak, final farewells and new beginnings, often in the same moment. In other words, it's the stuff of life itself, and it's glorious.

CREDITS WHERE CREDITS ARE DUE: You'll definitely want to stay throughout the credits of the film, which are peppered with closing scenes that are essential to tying up the overarching narrative. At the very end, you'll even be rewarded with a happy ending for one of Toy Story 4's most minor of characters.

RECOMMENDED? In every possible way. Toy Story 4 is a masterpiece of film-making, story-telling and animation. Delightful and devastating in equal measure, it might well be the silliest and most soul-stirring film you'll see this year.",10

Oh, the animation is great. But there's no soul to this movie. The team of characters we love are mostly absent, and the movie focuses on new characters and Woody. There's no depiction of the loving, loyal bonds between the toys that's been at the core of every Toy Story movie. And the ending, my god the ending. Who greenlit this ending and what were they smoking? My jaw hit the floor at the ending, and I was too confused by it to feel any emotion whatsoever. I literally walked out of the theater in a daze wondering what I'd just seen. It bore no resemblance to any previous movie in the franchise. Suffice it to say, the ending of this movie destroys every core principle of the toy world. It's completely out of character for Woody and flies in the face of everything we've learned about how these toys view their place in the human world and in each other's lives. They didn't need to make this movie, and I wish to heaven they hadn't, because it ruins my sense of where we left our toy friends at the end of TS3. I'll basically have to pretend TS4 doesn't exist, unless they ever make a TS5 that rights the wrongs committed by this one. If you loved the first three Toy Story movies and feel great attachment to their world, do yourself a favor and skip this one.

The animated franchise that has defined me as a filmgoer, filmmaker and writer. I'm turning 24 next month, and Toy Story has damn-near been in my life for all of those years.

The first film was released on Thanksgiving of 1995. I was 4 months old, sleeping in cribs, without any indication of what movies where, or for that matter, any kind of entertainment. But little did I know it would be the first film I would ever watch. The VHS was released the year after, and as I was learning to walk, talk and play, Toy Story played in the background. Something inside me clicked while I watched it. I was enchanted by it's world of make-believe. A world of talking toys. What more could a little kid want? My mother swears that I knew every line of dialogue from the film by the time I was 2 years old. Woody and Buzz where my bread and butter. I had both of them as toys of my own. To me, I was no different than Andy, because Andy was every kid in the world. What Toy Story so astoundingly captured was the bond between a child and his toy. It's unmistakeable and iconic. Needless to say, Toy Story was the family film we never knew we needed, as as a feat of technological genius, one of the finest films ever made.

Toy Story 2 was released 4 years later. By that time, I was old enough to see it in a theater. I'm happy to tell you that I still haven't forgotten the memory of seeing it nearly 20 years ago. My parents took me, and I took my Woody doll with me. We went on a cold and snowy November afternoon. I placed Woody next to me in my seat as the theater lights dimmed to darkness. We loved it. Not to mention, not a single dry eye in that audience during Jessie's ballad, ""When She Loved Me"". But from that experience, I vividly remember leaving Woody behind in the theater, and we had to drive all the way back to retrieve it. Life imitates art.

The gap between Toy Story 2 and 3 was 11 years. That's an eternity to a child. That's your entire elementary and middle school years in the books. I had enough Pixar movies in between to hold me over. By the time Toy Story 3 was released in the summer of 2010, I was already finished with my freshman year of high school. This time, I didn't see it in theaters, and I still don't know the reason. Was I going through a phase? Was I becoming cynical? Did i think I outgrew the material? Lord knows. I watched it when it premiered on cable later that year. That same spirit still stuck with me. The trilogy was complete, the toys left Andy and there was nothing else left to say.. or so we thought.

Toy Story 4 is here. I wouldn't blame you if you feel weary about that. If ever there was a film franchise that shouldn't be milked to death and exploited until every last capital of it has been exhausted, you are looking at it. To even justify a fourth installment, they needed to work hard and get it right. The weekend isn't over and the jury is still out, but i have my verdict. Toy Story 4 is necessary and beautiful. To all fans of the series and any fan of animation, drop what you are doing and see this now. This is worth an hour and change of watching non-streamable content. This is how cinema lives on in the year 2019. For me, as a grown man, this brings it all full circle.

We pick up right where we left off, with the toys belonging to little Bonnie. Still going on grand adventures in the bedroom. It's the first day of kindergarten for Bonnie, and she's too shy and scared to make any friends. Lucky for her, Woody comes to rescue and provides her with supplies to make her own friend. From there, we meet Forky. The product of what happens when toys play God. He's a stick figure made out of a spork, with a serious existential crisis. He keeps throwing himself in the trash. That's right, Forky is suicidal. You couldn't have a Pixar movie without throwing in a little dark social commentary. Bonnie and her parents take a road trip to an amusement park and the toys come with. But Woody gets carried away while guarding the troubled Forky. Woody and Forky get left behind after another episode, and vow to catch up to the park in the morning. As they walk into town, a vintage antique store catches Wood's eye with memorabilia attributed to Bo Peep, the toy that got away long, long ago. The antique store is filled with lost, abandoned toys, including a lonely girl doll named Gabby Gabby who's only friends are creepy ventriloquist dummies who stand upright on their own.. yeah, they are just as creepy as they sound. Forty is captured and Woody escapes the store. He lands in a nearby playground filled with even more abandoned toys, where he is reunited with none other than Bo Peep. It's been a long time since Woody has seen her and she's gotten a 2019 upgrade since. She's a swashbuckling badass now, accompanied with her tiny adorable sidekick, Officer Giggle McDimples. Woody and Bo join forces with Buzz , two smart-ass plush toys (voiced by Key and Peele) and a Canadian daredevil biker (voiced by Keanu Reeves) to save Forky and return him in one piece to Bonnie.

I could gush about this film for hours. First, on a technical level, Toy Story 4 is the most gorgeous looking film of the series. You can see every scratch, blemish and texture on every toy. Gone are the awkward polygons and fuzzy graphics of the Windows 95' generation. I was captivated by everything, from the photo realistic backgrounds to the shining reflective porcelain that gleams off of Bo Peep. It's as sharply funny as any of the Toy Story films, with enough adult asides to keep anyone in the audience from being alienated. It brings the series to an appropriate end that, while wasn't entirely necessary after the third film, concludes the journey of Woody and friends in a totally satisfying way.

Do I envision watching Toy Story 5 at 40 years old? Or 6 at 60? I don't know, but if indeed they are in the works, and if they are as lovely as all 4 previous films have been, I'll warmly invite the opportunities to see more. These movies awesome. To infinity and beyond.",10

Woody comes to terms with no longer being ""top toy"" and learns there are other ways to support and help a child, various female role models are strengthened in their portrayal and sometimes things that seem selfish can in fact be done for a goal that are entirely selfless.

But man, I was wrong. We were all wrong. From the first trailer, I thought it would have been disappointing, like I was with 'Incredibles 2', but I can say with much confidence, that 'Toy Story 4' was another satisfying entry in the 'Toy Story' series.

The Story: After the third film, me, like any other thought there was nowhere else to go with the series. As it felt like the perfect final chapter. However, it turns out you could still expand the story. As the writers thought of a perfect ending to the story of Woody. As in the film, Woody feels as if he doesn't belong, as cowboy doll is likely to not get the attention a little girl. Which leads to a satisfying ending to his arc. Not only that, but this is probably the most mature film in the series, as it deals with themes of independence, and being loved. The film also has very good comedic writing, in my opinion. This film is a logical progression of the story of the 'Toy Story' trilogy.

My only real issues with the story, is the fact that the other characters take a lot more a backseat than the other movies. However, this is Woody's movie, so I should expect it to not focus on them. And it is only a small criticism I have with the film's story.

The Characters: Both the new and old characters are either, just as good as they were in the previous films, and the new characters are nice additions to the 'Toy Story' series. They all go through a logical progression and grow as the film goes on, and the same thing goes for the new characters.

Animation: Like the previous films, the animation is just as good, and true Pixar level 3D animation. Of course the good animation quality is gonna be good, it's Pixar. But I still felt it's something to praise.

Conclusion: In conclusion, this film is an entertaining watch, a logical progression of the story, and a surprisingly satisfying film. It was worth the 9 year wait, and I loved this movie as much as the other films in the franchise. And some of Pixar's best work.",9

While at Kindergarten, Bonnie who is now the new owner of Andy's toys, with Woody (Tom Hanks), Buzz (Tim Allen), Jesse (Joan Cusack) and many more, she creates this character named Forky (Tony Hale) using arts and crafts materials, Forky may seem like a innocent toy, but he thinks he's not a toy, he thinks he is considered trash, so Woody has to stop him from going into the garbage, it makes it worse since Bonnie and his family are taking a vacation, Woody and Forky get lost, they end up in a antic shop, where Forky has been help captive by Gabby Gabby who is a creepy doll that has been in the shop for a long time, so Woody has to find him and get him back to Bonnie, now... where do I begin?, first off this is a really well crafted story, it has messages and themes throughout the entire movie just like the other movies, but the themes here are more meaningful and it can connect and relate to those who find the themes in the movie amazing, it is also funny, lots of clever humour and funny moments sprinkled throughout, it still has the same amount of heart that it always had, it's touching and especially emotional towards the end (don't worry, I won't give anything away), it's entertaining throughout and it put a big grin on my face, it had a lot of amazing ideas put into it as well and... the ending, It's such a heartbreaking and super sad ending that yes.... I cried, I cried with tears coming down my face, a popular example of a sad ending was Avengers: Endgame, I didn't cry at Endgame personally, but this movie.... this movie still had me thinking and I was still emotional after seeing it, the Pixar team did the best they could with the material that they got, they created a fantastically well put together plot, with strong writing, great humour, entertainment, wonderful heart and a really tear jerking ending that is a wonderful way to end the saga.

The animation is just unbelievable, Pixar has come along way with their animation, the first movie's animation was groundbreaking and new, they improved film by film, but here they really outdone themselves, this attention to detail in the animation is just incredible, each character has a wonderful design to them, the new characters look especially interesting, with Forky being the best looking character with what he can do, the backgrounds are photo realistic and beautiful, it's got great character animation and movement to it, when it comes to the fair ground, there's colour and beauty to it, the antic shop is old and grey but also somewhat scary, it has amazing lighting and cinematography to it, not much else to say but a visual achievement by a incredible animation studio, they went from groundbreaking animation, to mind blowing and jaw dropping animation, this is why Pixar is amazing at that they do.

The characters are truly wonderful, old and new, Woody is a even more fleshed out character then before, there's More purpose to him, he has a goal and hard choices to choose in the course of this movie, but still charming and loveable as ever, Buzz is still the loyal friend to Woody who would always help him whenever he needs it, Jessie is still a entertaining and likeable character, in fact the rest of the supporting characters from the other movies like Hamm, Rex, Slinky, Bullseye, Mr. And Mrs. Potato head are still funny and entertaining, the toys that Bonnie have are also the same, Bo Beep returns and is even better then she was before, her chemistry with Woody is wonderful and funny, now for the new characters, there's Forky who's charming, funny and plays a somewhat big part in the movie, Gabby Gabby was one character I didn't expect to love, but she was great, there's more to her then you would expect, Bunny and Ducky are really funny supporting characters, Duke Ca-Boom is a lot of fun, not only are the characters just amazing, same can apply to the voice acting, Tom Hanks is just incredible as Woody, Tim Allen is amazing as Buzz, Joan Cusack is wonderful as Jesse, everyone from the previous movies are amazing, the new characters have great voice actors too, Tony Hale is charming as Forky, Christina Hendricks is quite intense as Gabby Gabby, Key and Peele are funny as Bunny and Ducky, Keanu Reeves is surprisingly great as Duke Ca-Boom, the characters fully represent what it's like to be a toy, they have humour, heart, entertainment, whit, charm and great voice actors behind them, it's what make them truly a wonderful group of toys.

Wow......, this series feels completed now, after Toy Story 3 I didn't know how the fourth movie was going to top it, but it found a way and it did it in a amazing way, Toy Story 4 is a strong Pixar movie with incredible writing, animation that is mind boggling, characters with humour, heart and purpose along with terrific voice acting, Josh Cooley did a amazing job directing this movie, now... there is NO and I repeat NO need for a fifth movie because there is nothing else you can do with these characters, so I just want to say.... Pixar, thank you, thank you for all the good times with these characters, they made me laugh, they made me cry, they are always fun and entertaining, the movies have been incredible and moving, not one bad bit of filmmaking, but like all good things, it might come to an end and this ended off with something truly powerful and perfect, Toy Story 3 started the decade off in 2010 and now the fourth movie is ending the decade off, so it has been fun being with these characters and their adventures, we don't need anymore adventures, we have what we need for a saga... or should I say the best saga ever!..... so for that I want a big heartfelt and honest thank you to Pixar, I will continue to watch and support what you make and I do hope... that you continue to do more amazing stuff, hopefully Onward and Soul will be amazing also, so it's been fun but we made it to Infinity and Beyond...

Toy Story 4 most certainly gets a 10/10!.",10

Writing Credits: John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton, Josh Cooley, Valerie LaPointe, Rashida Jones, Will McCormack, Martin Hynes, Stephany Folsom.. (original story), Andrew Stanton and Stephany Folsom.. (screenplay). And starring: Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Annie Potts and Joan Cusack, besides some new members like Tony Hale as Forky, Keegan-Michael Key as Ducky, Jordan Peele as Bunny, Keanu Reeves as Duke Caboom and Christina Hendricks as Gabby Gabby.

Woody (voice of Tom Hanks) has always been confident about his place in the world, and that his priority is taking care of his kid, whether that's Andy or Bonnie. So when Bonnie's beloved new craft-project-turned-toy, Forky (voice of Tony Hale), declares himself as ""trash"" and not a toy, Woody takes it upon himself to show Forky why he should embrace being a toy. But when Bonnie takes the whole gang on her family's road trip excursion, Woody ends up on an unexpected detour that includes a reunion with his long-lost friend Bo Peep (voice of Annie Potts). After years of being on her own, Bo's adventurous spirit and life on the road belie her delicate porcelain exterior. As Woody and Bo realize they're worlds apart when it comes to life as a toy, they soon come to find that's the least of their worries.

I'm a huge fan of the Toy Story saga, I loved all the predecessors, I think Toy Story 3 is one of the best movies of all time, and the first Toy Story movie is one of the best comedies of all time.. also Toy Story 2 -as lots of people agreed, myself included- is one of the best sequels of all time! I thought TS3 has the best conclusion to this amazing saga, and I didn't expect a TS4 at all, and when they announced it, I had no clue how this movie will go after the amazing emotional conclusion we had in TS3... Untill the trailer that I really loved, but I also THOUGHT that it showed too much, why did I say it like that? 'Cause I was wrong, and everyone who thinks that the trailer showed too much, I respect your opinion, but it didn't.. at all! I don't wanna spoil anything until everyone gets to see this masterpiece in theaters, but I'd say that the trailer misguided us, in a perfect way, don't get me wrong.

Okay, where do I start?... Let's start with how people was truly trashing this movie, before even the trailer! I mean I understand that people were afraid, but at least give it a chance.. I guess now they would, because the movie got some pretty serious amazing reviews everywhere.. and I'm so happy, cause this movie is a blast, I was totally blown away of how well-made this movie is! From the cinematography to the funny scenes, to the score, the animation, the new crew, characters -old and new-, the emotional beats to the conclusion, maybe.. we still don't know if it's the last or not, but they gonna make it as wonderful as the saga is, go on, I'm in!!

Let's talk about the cinematography, it's Josh Cooley's very first full feature movie, and I was concerned a little bit, because John Lasseter did an amazing job with the first two, and Lee Unkrich was magnificent also, he did a fascinating job with the third one. So did Josh Cooley with TS4, every scene was just beautifully directed, with a great animation... Actually, TS4 has the best animation of ALL TIME, Pixar really did an amazing job with this saga, from the very first CGI animated movie, to a very great improvement, to the best of the recent time, until TS4.. the best so far.... It never was that realistic before, even Incredibles 2 wasn't that amazing.. this is the animation of the decade, every shot felt SO REAL!!!!

The score was amazing.. again! As a comedy, this movie made me cry from laughing like 3 or 4 times, and all the rest of the movie was really funny too! People were actually asking if they have to bring some tissues with them, I'd say.. yeah, bring a lot, cause my theater was wiping, I lost it even more than I did in TS3.. it has a very good emotional conclusion and I loved it! The plot, is really cool, no spoilers, it's just.. surprising.. go with no mentality and have fun with it, cause whenever you feel like it's another episodic Toy Story movie -as the trailer showed us- the movie won't stop surprising you!

The new members were really great.. Bunny and Ducky are really funny, Forky, the one that I was really thinking that he's going to annoy me, he was great, really sweet and cute, and of course adds a lot to the movie. Duke Caboom is amazing, it's a great role for Keanu Reeves, there's a story behind him, I felt it was unnecessary, but it helps the movie somehow.

As flaws, finally.. in this year, I found none.. this is a perfect flawless movie, the one and only so far that really deserves the highest grade, best movie of the year so far, but I don't think that something is gonna surpass it actually, to be honest.

Toy Story 4 is NOT just another Toy Story movie, it has a great message to EVERYONE, so emotional, funny and beautifully animated and directed, Toy Story 4 of course gets an A+!

Alright, guys.. thank you for reading my review, look forward to more reviews really soon, especially the Toy Story saga reviews which is really soon... Thank you.",10

So when it was announced by Pixar that a fourth movie was in the works I was sceptical at best and terrified at worst. And boy was I right to be worried. Sitting through this movie was an incredibly dull experience for me and my friends, we were coming willing to give it a chance yet it still disappointed. The plot is paper thin and covers all the old ground of the other movies but significantly worse, the voice acting was passable with Tom Hanks probably giving the strongest performance, the animation and lighting was easily the most enjoyable part of the film, this is Pixar's best looking film and it's a marvel seeing how far they've evolved since the original Toy Story. This isn't enough to save the movie however as the amazing visuals are constantly overshadowed by the mediocre writing and story. Overall this movie doesn't really try in regards to the story, the animation really showed how much effort was put in to make this the best looking Pixar film, but beyond that it's pretty shallow. Check this movie out if you just want to see Woody and Buzz again, but if your looking for a movie that is anything above mediocre you'll be severely disappointed.",4

Toy Story 3 ended on a very definitive note. It felt the like the final chapter had closed and that there didn't need to be another film. Not to mention that after having created what is generally considered one of the strongest film trilogies ever made, Pixar would be tempting the fates by creating another one. But they did it! Toy Story 4 is an utterly entertaining film.

This film's feel seems to be created to directly contrast with 3. Whereas the last movie was darker and felt stretched out, this film feels more lighthearted and fluidly compact. This is the installment that is trying the most to have fun.

Don't consider this purely a frivolous film. The ending is almost as strong as in the last movie, and I felt that one was only better only by a thin margin. Things get pretty emotional.

The entire film is about Woody (Tom Hanks) having an existential crisis. Once a favorite plaything and the leader of Andy's toys, Woody is now one of his new owner's least played with toys and being a newcomer, no longer the leader. His whole journey is pretty compelling.

The biggest reason this movie justifies it's existence is that not only do we have closure for Bo Beep (Ghostbuster's Annie Potts), but her character is finally given justice. In the original film, it seems she was part of the cast just because they needed at least a couple female characters. Her role didn't serve much purpose other than to be Woody's girlfriend. Same with the sequel. You could've cut the character out, and it wouldn't affect anything. Then, in number three, she was just out of the story entirely, having already been sold to a new owner. The writer's reasoning at the time was that due to the heavy action scenes, I'm guessing primarily the moments where the toys are roughed up by toddlers, Bo Beep being porcelain and fragile was difficult to include. Here she's finally give her due. She has more personality, she has agency, and she is finally part of the action and story.

New character Forky (voiced by Veep and Arrested Development's Alan Hale) is an inspired creation, a handicraft toy made out of a spork who's dealing with sudden sentience. He works well interacting with Woody as they share questions about their existence in the world. I actually felt the character was underutilized a bit. (It did annoy me a little that the writers were selective about how much or little knowledge of the world Sporky had.)

The new villain Gabby Gabby (Christina Hendricks) is yet another emotionally damaged toy. Don't worry about her being a clone of the last two. They go down a refreshingly different path with her.

Though I enjoyed the story, I do admit that the movie basically copies the formula of the first two films by having a few characters separated from the others and going on a journey. The movie may as well be called Woody Story as the majority of the cast is sidelined for the film and even Buzz is more of a supporting player. A lot of time is spent on the new characters. Though I can't complain much as they all are pretty entertaining. (Ducky and Bunny (Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele) bring us the funniest joke in the entire series.)

I'd rank this only under number 2. TS4 is a blast and I recommend this to all Toy Story fans.",10

After the release of Toy Story 2 in 1999, many believed the franchise had ended, until a third film came along over ten years later. Really putting a capper on the Toy Story story as fans knew it from the beginning, Toy Story 3 was a definitive conclusion. So why was a third instalment even in the works? Until the release of the movie, that was the question on many viewers' minds. Personally, upon the initial announcement a few years back, I was against this movie, but I've loved these films since the beginning, so of course, I was going to check this one out, and I'm glad that I did. Toy Story 4 has earned a worthy place in the franchise in my eyes.

Picking up pretty soon after the events of the third film, we now see how our favourite, loveable toys have moved on from their previous owner (Andy) and how they've settled in with their new one in Bonnie. Without getting into the specifics of how or why a new toy (Forky) is introduced, I'll just simply state that Bonnie builds him at school and he miraculously comes to life, giving Woody a new job, so to speak. The plot really kicks into gear, However, when Forky is thrust onto the street during a family vacation, and the Woody/Forky excursion begins. Each toy has a moment to shine, but this truly is a film about Woody.

I could immediately dive into negatives and say that Buzz Lightyear doesn't have enough screen time or that reference and lines of dialogue from previous movies are slightly repeated too much throughout the duration of the movie, but that would just be me complaining about an otherwise near-perfect animated film. I had nitpicks here and there while watching the movie, but I just have to be honest and say the overall movie surrounding those inner quarrels were just scratches on a canvas that was painted beautifully as a whole.

As always, the animation is astounding and life-like at times, which feels a little funny when comparing it to how simple the animation was in the original film, so the movie was beautiful to look at. On top of that, this is a film filled with heart, that cares about its characters, and even takes the time to introduce many new, memorable faces along the way. From Ducky and Bunny to Duke Caboom, these new characters will actually remain in my mind as memorable side characters, which is what many sequels fail to do these days.

In the end, fans of the first three movies are more than likely going to love watching this instalment, newcomers will get a fresh story now that a previous chapter has been closed, and fans of comedy will also get many clever laughs here as well. I'm not ready to call Toy Story 4 my favourite film of the franchise by any means, but in terms of character progression, emotion, and an overall extremely enjoyable film, I would be lying if I didn't say that I loved it. Yes, I have minor issues, but they are so small that I just feel like giving this one a perfect grade, which I haven't given to many films in 2019. Toy Story 4 is a wonderful time at the movies and I highly recommend it.",10

The story is same as the premise of the third part of the franchise but only this time it deals with a much wider variety of topics: self-association in the society, loyalty, shattering of dreams, search for your purpose in life, definition of friendship, dissatisfaction with your current life status and the list goes on.

Toy Story 4 is a mind-blowing film. Director Josh Cooley has wonderfully brought us a very unique & unforgettable Toy Story movie, after the superlative Toy Story(1995), Toy Story 2(1999) & Toy Story 3(2010). I was skeptical when I first found out that Pixar was making this film. Toy Story 3(2010) was the perfect conclusion to this franchise. However, I stand corrected. Toy Story 4 fantastically wraps up the adventures of Woody, Buzz, Jessie & the rest of the gang. The animation is top-notch. The 3D is eye-popping. The humor & emotional scenes, have been perfectly balanced throughout. The vocal performances are the highlight of the movie. Tom Hanks is spectacular as Woody. Tim Allen is great as Buzz Lightyear.

The writing remains top-notch, exploring thought-provoking dilemmas that have the protagonists (and audience) often second-guessing themselves and make the villains and their motivations understandable and investing. I also found 4 to be the funniest of the series. Forky, Ducky and Bunny (played by Tony Hale from Arrested Development, Key and Peele, respectively) are the comedic highlights; I was legitimately laughing out loud at their dialogue and antics. Toy Story 4 is far from the cash grab many thought it would be. It's sharply written, beautifully animated and brings the series to an emotionally satisfying conclusion. What a journey.",10

Thus, Spider-Man: Homecoming was born and its sequel, this year's Far From Home: where Peter Parker is on holiday in Europe and he'll come to terms with his own sense of responsibility and belonging in the world.

Far From Home is another solid entry in a very thorough film franchise: and it helps that Spider-Man's an equal favourite superhero of mine, equal to Superman and Batman. This film extends the web-slinger's legacy and shows he can still be re-imagined in many ways to fit today's very demanding cinematic landscape. Also, even though there are plenty of post-Endgame twists addressed in this movie, it has some rather nice ones of its own making: one in particular which was NEVER teased or implied in the trailers (or rather, make that TWO secret twists).

Spider-Man's here to stay, and it seems like the best is yet to come. Who knows? I'm looking forward to seeing where the story goes next.",9

Those who are unfamiliar with the MCU might find some plot points confusing, but can probably enjoy the story as a whole.

Peter is still a high schooler in this movie, and though he has matured a bit since Homecoming, his character still feels refreshingly youthful. There is a big difference in his motivation between Homecoming and Far From Home, though, brought about by the events of Infinity War and Endgame. All the characters are back in style, just as enjoyable as ever - MJ is much more important, and very skillfully played by Zendaya. This movie feels joyful and summery but still manages to address a very real issue, and give Peter some definitive character moments.

My main complaint about this movie was that it felt too short! I wanted it to keep going, possibly having been influenced by Endgame's super-long runtime. However, it has everything a movie should have. I feel that it falls just a tiny bit short of the mark set by Homecoming, lacking something to live up to that one jaw-dropping moment in Homecoming (you know what I mean). Yet, it continues this Spider-Man's story very convincingly, so I can't really assign fault there. In short, this movie is definitely worth seeing if you enjoyed Homecoming, and a must-see if you are at all invested in the MCU.",9

Tom Holland continues to do a spectacular job as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Jacob Batalon continues to be the funny best friend that always has Peter's back throughout their trip far from home. Zendaya is great as MJ and it was nice to see more of her in this movie than from Homecoming. Samuel L Jackson always does an amazing job whenever he appears as Nick Fury, and him teaming up with Spider-Man was awesome (with lots of funny moments). John Favreau made Happy Hogan become one of my favorite side characters after the movie ended. Also, Jake Gyllenhaal simply KILLED IT as Mysterio. His performance was phenomenal; add all the CGI to it and my mind was blown out the roof! I give Spider-Man Far From Home a 10/10. Can the next Spider-Man movie come out already???",10

I went into this movie without watching any teaser, trailers or tv spots. I did read about Mysterio though since I haven't read the comic which was a mistake in my part. My advise is if you haven't seen the trailer and don't know Mysterio please refrain from it, you will enjoy the movie a lot more.

Now coming on the review, this is by far the Best sequel I have seen. We see spidey taking a Europe trip with school to get away from spidey routine and focus more on his love interest but things don't always go as planned. New threats emerges from another dimension that threatens the existence of earth and spidey now has to face that. Who is Mysterio? What's his role? What's next for spidey after Endgame? Is he the new Iron man? That's for you to watch find out and be blown away. The movie has a few surprises and has one mid credit and one end credit scene. The mid credit scene is the final end of the movie and end credit scene reveals a secret. The mid credit scene was the best scene I have ever seen in a marvel movie.

Tom Holland has definitely taken Spider-Man to a new level. His sense of humor, facial expression and the fact this reboot takes place in HS days definitely adds to the movie. I was surprise how they continued the story after end game and how the mid credit scene shows what's coming next for Spider-Man. I really hope Spider-Man doesn't end with part III and they continue to make Spider-Man with Tom Holland.

Go watch it and you won't regret it",10

This time, he and his friends go on vacation in Europe, and discover the Elementals attacking the continent, which prompts Peter to swing into action to save the day with a new hero on the scene known as Mysterio.

This movie felt refreshing and lighthearted to me, and I think we all needed it after the more serious Captain Marvel and Endgame. This isn't to say, however, that this film is without its serious moments. In terms of lighthearted fun, we obviously get to see some comedic moments thrown around throughout the film. As an example, we get to see how the world has been affected by the events of Infinity War and Endgame, and they are done in a fairly comedic way. As for the serious moments, we see Peter dealing with what happened to Tony Stark during the previous film, and how he feels the need to step up his game. This leads him into an arc where he needs to learn to become more responsible, especially since he is now on his own. I thought that the action scenes were interesting as well, as they tread some new ground by Marvel movie standards, though I won't go into it because it goes into spoiler territory.

My only complaint with the film is with the villain. Once we find out who he is and what his backstory is, for me, he turned out to be generic and uninteresting in the longrun. I felt as if his backstory in particular felt rushed. In addition to this, his goal throughout the movie didn't feel original. Again, I don't want to get into spoilers, but I will say that he feels a bit like a clone of another Disney villain from his goals and motivation.

Despite my complaints with the movie's antagonist, I still felt as if Spider-man: Far From Home was a refreshing film, especially after the previous MCU movies.

The acting in the film is taken up a notch from Homecoming, and subtly focuses more on the characters and delves deeper into each one as the journey goes along. The film also shines, go figure for a Marvel film, in terrific special effects. That being said, the pacing throughout the film makes the whole tone feel kinda odd, and though it may be fast to act, it makes for a hard time of putting things truly together. At times the film also falls down to its own formulaic tropes, and the film can feel bland because of them. However, it isn't all downhill from there. A healthy blend of action and humor is more than enough to satisfy throughout its 2 hour plus runtime, as well as always, the excitement of what is to come next. My Rating: 9/10",9

Far From Home felt fresh than that same formula , the movie itself delivers what you want from typical super-hero movie , even better than the previous spider-man live action in sense of plot , acting , action

Just a few words of description of the plot are enough to put it on your ""must see"" list: ""A struggling musician has a cycling accident during a freak global blackout and wakes to a world where noone other than him remembers the Beatles or any of their songs."" When I heard this I said to myself ""yes, Yes, YES""! But would it live up to my expectations?

This is a Richard Curtis penned film, and that's immediately enough to put a tranche of movie-goers off. All his movies have an accent on the uplifting, the positive and/or the whimsical, and I can understand why that winds some people up. If ""Richard-Curtissy"" was an adjective, and I think it should be, many of these films can be so classified.

Here, although again very Richard-Curtissy, I think he gets the mixture JUST RIGHT.... ""Yesterday"", for me, was a complete joy from beginning to end.

I imagine Curtis getting this story from a rowdy dinner party round his gaff. He asks his guests, over the third bottle of dessert wine, to play a wild and fantastical ""what if"" game (in pursuit of the ""very good"" spare brownie of course). At this particular event, I guess it was co-story-author Jack Barth (in his movie-writing debut) that made the successful attempt to ""hog the brownie"". For the premise of ""Yesterday"" is quite brilliant, whilst at the same time being utterly bonkers too!

That being said, the story is not completely original. I thought there were many similarities to the Ricky Gervais vehicle of 2009, ""The Invention of Lying"", where Gervais alone finds he suddenly has the ability to tell lies, and finds ill-gotten fortune and fame as a result. Much like that earlier film, much of the joy here is in the recognition of the gift given and the dawning realisation of what this might actually mean to him. As such, I found the first half of the film a lot more enjoyable than the second.

The conundrum facing Jack is to remeber all of the Beatles songs and their lyrics (without having Google as a reference), and much fun is had with him stumbling into situations that suddenly remind him of a new track or a particular snatch of lyric.

There is of course an obvious explanation for the whacky storyline, since the hero has received a potentially serious head injury. But would the film go there? (No spoilers here).

Himesh Patel is from TV's ""Eastenders"" but here makes his movie debut. He is perfectly cast as Jack Malik: in the film, he's a name about to rise from utter obscurity as a Lowestoft retail assistant to global superstardom. Patel is charming and believable as he squirms with his conscience. A surprising and touching beach scene in the final reel of the film is exquisitely acted.

The ever-watchable and utterly gorgeous Lily James here goes brunette: she was actually unrecognisable to me from both the trailer and the poster! Here she makes a very believable high-school teacher with a side-line in management and roadie-ing.

I found Ed Sheeran's cameo in ""Bridget Jones Baby"" to be excruciating! But here, in what is quite an extensive part, he is much, much better. I think he's been getting lessons.

One of the slight disappointments with the film is that it is a Danny Boyle film that doesn't FEEL like a Danny Boyle film. Aside from some inventive on-screen titles, I didn't detect much of the stylisation that I would expect from one of his films. Yes, there are occasional flashes of genius - for example, the scenes where Malik is desperately trying to remember the lyrics of Eleanor Rigby, and those of him watching, big screen, his own social-media led rise to super stardom. But otherwise, the visuals and storyline are pretty linear in nature.

Although there are cloyingly gooey bits of this film, the element that weaves it all together - such that ""all is forgiven"" in my book - is the magical music and lyrics of McCartney, Lennon and Harrison.

Was there a better year to be born that 1961? (Well, possibly the mid- to late- 50's so you were old enough to remember more of it). But although only a child aged between two and nine during their album releases, I felt the benefit of three older siblings who WERE able to fully embrace Beatlemania. And the film delights with its modern day recreations of the classic tracks and, as already mentioned, Himesh Patel belts them out wonderfully (especially, I thought, with ""Help!"").

I can't not give this one 10 stars. I simply loved it, and can't wait for its general release (in the UK, on June 28th 2019) so I can go and love it all over again. Is it technically a 10-star film? Possibly not, but sometimes you just have to go with the way a film makes you feel, not just as you walk, whistling, out of the cinema but for the whole of the next 48 hours and (I suspect) longer. In summary, he loves it. ""Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeeeeeaaaaaah"".

Yesterday is the next movie based on the classic song sang by a classic musicians. But unlike Bohemian Rhapsody and Rocketman which are biography movies. Yesterday is a fantasy comedy movie which is a different take from the previous two. Did the movie deliver or did the movie disappoint. After seeing the first trailer back in February I was very interested in the its unique concept of the movie.

The plot for the movie centers around Jack Malek who is a struggling musician until he had a bus crash while power was turned off about 12 seconds he then finds out that he is the only person who knows the songs of the Beatles.

The movie delivered on its premised in a lot of levels. The performances by Himesh Patel and Lily James was excellent they had great chemistry and you can feel their friendship grew throughout the movie. I thought Ed Sheeran wasn't that bad in the movie and he was a lot better than I expecting considering that most real life musicians acting was mostly bad. The movie featured lots of classic Beatles which was great even though Let It Be was on briefly I was expecting a full version of the record in the movie. But that didn't ruin the whole movie. The ending of movie was very moving and emotional don't going to say anything about the ending but it was lovely ending.

Overall the movie was excellent it was original but unlike a lot of original movies that has a great premise but didn't deliver this movie does deliver with great performances and a wonderful ending this movie is to enjoy by everyone who loves the the Beatles or just want to have a great fun time at the cinema.

Or rather, if nobody remembered The Beatles, except the former teacher, protagonist who also happens to be a struggling singer songwriter who is nearing the 10,000 hour mark of his up to now futile music career.

Was it 'merely' the underlying brilliance of Lennon and McCartney that propelled The Beatles to stardom in the 60's? Is it simply catchy tunes and meaningful lyrics that led to the perennial relevance of The Beatles catalog? Is this an ongoing cultural phenomenon demonstrated by the passing of love of Beatles music from parent to child, fan to the uninitiated, that continues, fervently, even today? These might be a few of the questions that ran through my head as the plot unfolded manifest in another question: could one guy with a guitar replicate The Fab Four's success?

As a bit of a Beatles fan, the subtext to the film, contrasts the roles that a select few beyond the fab four played in The Beatles success with the movie's equivalents. As a snarky jab at the music industry, Brian Epstein's meticulous eye for detail is hearkened and contrasted with Kate McKinnon, whose performance is at once spot on and over the top. Her character is undoubtedly the tip of the iceberg for those archetype 'gonna conquer the world' southern California denizens, yet rings hollow in a few spots. The distinction is poignant for a Danny Boyle movie, normally the complete opposite of tone deaf, and while I chose to include it here, the scene(s) I reference may be cut from the final release version. (For edification purposes: the music studio in L.A.)

Speaking of the studio, The Beatles, simply would not be without the mastery of studio producer George Martin. The orchestral arrangements, the sound story mentality, the embracing of The Beatles' desire to embrace the latest technologies are a few of the ways in which Martin guided the manifestation of magic conveyed on vinyl. The film, in this regard, is light on the complexity and development of the sound over time and focuses instead, even acknowledges, that Jack's is a lesser reflection of the brilliance of The Beatles, with a few laugheties about lyric selection.

Which is not to say that the interpretations of the songs chosen are not without merit. The sincere portrayal of 'Yesterday' provides a solid framing for the rest of the movie. 'In my Life' plays a vital role in driving the movie forward, and appropriately so. And the at once nuanced, yet in your face pleading of 'Help' is a true reading of the song's rarely spoken meaning appropriate to the character and plot. Patel's rendering, spoken and sung, is true.

What is a bit muddled is the inability for interpersonal communication in a world without a common language of love, alongside earworm hooks, impeccably delivered by John, Paul, George, and Ringo. Instead it takes a plot twist I didn't anticipate, to initiate the third half of the movie resolution.

Ultimately, the movie succeeds at contemplating how a struggling musician / teacher might navigate the complicated waters of being the one person in the world who remembers and can perform The Beatles...A Long and Winding Road indeed!",8

No, absolutely not. But in an age of superhero movies and musical biopics, to have such an original idea be brought to life about a band that is seemingly larger than life was a joy to watch. There are a few sequences and jokes that don't hit their mark, but the theme of the movie certainly does. Love. It was more of a romance than I thought it would be, but the undeniable chemistry between Jack (Himesh Patel) and Ellie (the lovely Lily James) turned this movie from solid to a very good movie. You begun to wonder halfway through the third act how they're going to tie this together and let's just say, you won't see it coming. All I have to say is: Wow. The movie also reminded me how timeless their music is, being a fan I have to say you come to re-appreciate the genius of Paul and George and Ringo and John, in a way that cut's even deeper while paired with the romance with Jack and Ellie. If you are not a Beatles fan (how can you not be?), the movie will undoubtedly lose some of it's effect and charm, but it will still carry itself through guest appearances by Ed Sheeran (who did a very good job) and funny sequences.

If you truly want to know who the Beatles were, I recommend Mark Lewisohn's brilliant biography, ""Tune In"". The Beatles 4 Ever!",1

 There was a time when Danny Boyle was a director who's projects were considered edgy and each one of them had their own style. What if just like in Yesterday, he all of a sudden forgot about his previous work and decided to work with screenwriter Richard Curtis (Love, Actually) to makes the most dull film we've ever seen of him? Well, that scenario doesn't seem too crazy..

""Yesterday"" stars Himesh Patel (Eastenders) and the usually very energetic Lily James (Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again) to play a struggling singer-songwriter and his manager/love interest - yet Patel's character is completely clueless to the moves she makes.

 Jack Malik (Patel) is ready to give up his dying career as a wannabe singer, when he gets knocked down by a bus in the middle of a global electricity outage. He wakes up in the hospital and soon finds out nobody has ever heard of the legendary band The Beatles (as well as some other brands/objects, which is clearly a perfect opportunity for the filmmakers to incorporate plenty of product placement.. Michael Bay would be proud.).

When Jack sees an opportunity to make bank, he knows just the way how to get people's attention by writing down the lyrics of every song The Beatles have ever released - at least the ones he can remember. He claims to be the sole writer of these songs and after appearing on a morning show on local television, he gets discovered by Ed Sheeran and invited to accompany him on his upcoming world tour as the singer's opening act. When Sheeran's crazed agent Hannah (Kate McKinnon) approaches the rising superstar to sign him to her label, he has no idea where this rapidly progressing voyage will take him.

Not only will he discover how fame can blind you from what's right in front of you, he will also learn the true meaning of the phrase ""the grass isn't always greener on the other side"". Girl-next-door Elly (James) was his rock from day one. Seeing her being pushed aside by his own greediness makes him realise what he's really been missing in life: love. It's supposed to be a very British romantic comedy with a highly original concept that leans towards fantasy.

 Yesterday could've been the sweet antidote in a world filled with sequels and blockbusters, but nothing is more disappointing than to see a well-accomplished director as Boyle screw it all up. The direction is all over the place with inter-titles and unbelievable scenes that won't fly in the world we live in right now. It is too realistic to be set in a fantasy world and the film never pulls you in completely. Even the funny one liners and McKinnon's delightful comedic punches as a stereotypical Hollywood agent, can't save how ordinary ""Yesterday"" feels. And if you're really here for the music, I have to disappoint you. The few music montages are not even worth the admission, since most of the performances get cut short. Just let it be.

Wooden acting. Lead actor zero charisma & dull. Humour completely inoffensive, the sort of progressive, liberalist idea of comedy with no edge. Low energy, flat & like the Lead actor quite depressing when it should have been lively, exuberant & exciting like the Beatles themselves. In a nutshell, this movie should reflect why The Beatles were so important to the world & by watching this travesty, if this was my first introduction to their music I would be seriously underwhelmed. Oh & Sheeran was really wooden & flat too. He couldn't even play himself properly. Truly awful, avoid this at all costs!",1

In moments, those substance-less joys earn their cuteness. But, as with writer Richard Curtis's other films (About Time), there's a unique ethical question underscoring the surface: what rights does an artist have over a creation they didn't create? Should we be honest about ""reality"" when that reality isn't reality? Confused? Don't worry; that complexity is all but completely brushed under the rug here, opting instead for cheap explanations and corny romance. Because of unimportant and uninteresting reasons, an aspiring musician (Patel) discovers he is the only person in the world who remembers The Beatles. Patel is great in the lead; with impeccable timing and effortless charm, he manages to steal all these classic songs without losing our sympathy. He's supported by a handful of genuinely funny and sweet moments: jokes at the expense of Oasis and Ed Sheeran, the reveals of other erased cultural touchstones (Coca-Cola, Harry Potter, etc), even a surprisingly moving reveal of others who remember the past. Unfortunately, the story doesn't do much to help. Lazy storytelling shortcuts are taken at every turn, making a fantastical concept even more difficult to believe. Curtis is usually quite adept with this type of rom-dramedy, but he's not at the helm here. Boyle is, and he's known for his hyper-stylized direction, which proves problematic. Where he spends time working on montages of ridiculous metaphorical storytelling devices, he should be fleshing out character motivations and ethical conundrums. Yesterday makes me glad we live in a reality with The Beatles, so we can ignore this movie and stay home to listen to Abbey Road.",4

I feel like people are going to expect something the likes of Bohemian Rhapsody or Rocketman, but that's not the case. This story is more about the lead character, with the sprinkled essence of the Beatles. Now that we've got that out of the way, this was an absolute delight. It's been some time since I've seen a Danny Boyle film, but I'm glad he's still got that unique touch.

This movie feels different. It's shot quite well (beautiful cinematography), the humor is brilliant (I burst out laughing multiple times), the story is fun (absolutely childish), the themes are subtle (but impactful) and the character satire is on point. Everyone has memorable moments in this film.

The story is a weird mix of unpredictable and cliche, but it's paced well. The first two acts fly by, leaving you with a slightly long,but acceptable climax. It's also riddled with meta-references,so if pop culture is your thing, entertainment is guaranteed.

If you appreciate the following, you will enjoy this film - British dark comedy, the music industry, irony and anti-humor, the love for Beatles (in that order)

I know that this is a relatively minor film in the summer scape,but it's worth your time,if you choose to see it. It's most certainly the funniest movie I've seen this summer.",9

""So, we have this guy who is basically a 30-something loser...""

""Not a promising beginning...""

""But, see, he loves making music... he's just not very good at it...""

""Let me guess: A magic genie grants him three wishes, and for his first wish, he becomes the next Chris Martin.""

""Funny you should mention Coldplay... no, actually, what happens is an unexplained phenomenon leaves him sitting on a gold mine of hit songs from 50 years ago that he can co-opt, and he becomes a superstar overnight.""

""Fifty years ago? What, does he discover a vault of unreleased Brian Wilson songs or something?""

""Not exactly. He gets hit by a bus and wakes up to discover a world that never knew the Beatles.""

""So he goes back in time?""

""No, this isn't 'Back to the Future Part 4.' He just... starts singing Beatles songs and suddenly, he's an overnight sensation.""

""Do kids today even know who the Beatles were? Maybe he should wake up and become the next Kanye West or Chance the Rapper.""

""The premise is that Beatles music is timeless, and a world that never heard 'Hey Jude' will still go bananas for it in 2019.""

""Hmmm. We'll have to agree to disagree on that one. But anyway, this makes him very happy, right? I mean, he suddenly has everything: fame, fortune, and throngs of groupies beating down his door, right?""

""Uh... not quite. This guy has a conscience, and stealing all of those songs just makes him feel guiltier and guiltier. And he's pretty morose to begin with, so despite everything, his success only makes him more miserable.""

""I mean, there is a girl...""

""Thank God. So he steals the Beatles songs to get the girl? And they fall in love and live happily ever after, right?""

""Actually, he steals the songs to save his music career. He is very conflicted about the girl...""

""I thought you said he didn't have a music career.""

""He didn't, really. But now he does.""

""Let me get this straight. He becomes the next Paul McCartney, if Paul McCartney was a 30-something loser in the 21st century, but it doesn't make him happy, and he doesn't get the girl.""

""I wouldn't put it quite like that, but...""

""Is there a lot of sex in the movie at least?""

""No-o-o-o-o-o, not really...""

""But he is surrounded by really funny, clever supporting characters, right? Actors who steal scenes, make witty asides, and help him navigate this crazy situation?""

""Actually, no. The supporting cast is rather bland, and he's pretty much going it alone.""

(silence)

""There are also some other things that this 'new' world has never heard of... common products, other bands, things like that.""

""So the movie explores those ideas as well? And conversely, are there common products and superstar artists in this 'new' world that the musician is not familiar with? That would lend itself to some funny situations...""

""Um... no and no.""

(silence)

""There are a LOT of Beatles songs in the movie, though...""

""So I'm assuming that the audience is treated to some clever, ironic scenes about those songs, which brings the music to life and gives it depth as well as topical significance?""

""Actually... no. The musician just keeps churning out these Beatles songs like a hyper-spastic jukebox, which, of course, he knows all the lyrics for and all of the chord progressions by heart.""

(silence)

""He does turn one of the Beatles songs into a kind of punk anthem...""

""Well, that's something I guess. And I'm assuming the movie builds to a joyous crescendo, with some poignancy, pathos and heartwarming resolution?""

""Not really. It just sort of peters out, kind of like rock music itself did in the 1990s.""

(silence)

""The musician is really good at playing the Beatles songs...""

""So if he's mopey and depressed all the time, can I assume that at least he's someone that the girls will go ga-ga over? I mean, he's got that Brad Pitt look at least, right?""

(sigh) ""Um... actually, his looks are not his best quality.""

(silence)

""But, hey, I have an idea for how to film the trailer. We can make the movie seem like a joyous fantasy, and that should be enough for a decent opening weekend.""

(sigh) ""If you say so. So, what other ideas do you have?""

""Well, what about a movie where the president of the United States used to be a reality show star? And even though he is sexist, racist and altogether clueless, he is reelected and names himself as the first U.S. dictator, becoming president-for-life?""

""And I thought the Beatles idea was far-fetched. Of course, that is a premise that would drive the snowflakes crazy... who do you see in the lead?""

I was a fan of Lily James, but not of Himesh Patel. He's not a bad actor, just, in my opinion, not the right one for this part. And no, this has nothing to do with him being part Indian. In fact, there is one Indian actor that would have been, in my opinion, great in it and that is Ayushmann Khurrana, who was terrific in ""Andhadhun"".

The love story between Patel and James seems forced as there was, again in my opinion, not much chemistry between these two. Also, there were many times when it seems a scene was supposed to be funny and it just fell flat. Too bad to as the character ""Rocky"" was very good. Too bad the scenes were not funny enough. But this isn't really a Rom-Com, it's more of a Rom-Drama. So don't think you will be laughing most of the time, because you will not be.

As you know, this is an alternate reality movie. The filmmakers did have one funny bit. The Beatles are not the only thing missing from this universe. The other items will NOT be revealed here, but it's pretty clever what else is missing.

All is all, not something I can recommend. I saw it for $5.00 at a local matinee time movie, so if you want the movie theater experience of seeing this movie, then go to the matinee time.

Here, Danny Boyle and Richard Curtis approach a weighty 'what if' question to terrify all music aficionados... what if the Beatles never existed? Or, more suitably, what if only one man (luck would have it a down-on-his-luck singer-songwriter) remembered their classic tunes? In Yesterday, that man is Jack Malik (Himesh Patel in his big-screen debut), who is conveniently hit by a bus simultaneously as a split-second power outage hits the globe. Jack awakens in this all but identical parallel dimension; except no one has heard of John, Paul, George or Ringo. It's not long before our protagonist starts to realise that this isn't a curse but rather a blessing as he starts to gain huge success by painstakingly recreating the band's songs and claiming them as his own to the unknowing world. The concept of Yesterday is an intriguing one, if a little familiar. What would perhaps be most exciting about the film however is that it sees two tour de forces of British cinema, Boyle and Curtis, working together for the first time. In Yesterday, it feels as if Boyle's contribution seems slightly smothered in the tone and style of the latter; this feels very much like a Richard Curtis affair and unfortunately not an entirely brilliant one. In the first third of the film, the pace breezes nicely along; we are introduced to Jack and his hum-drum life, including his curious relationship with manager Ellie (the endlessly charismatic Lily James). There's some classic Curtis writing here; joshing banter, wry humour and a good level of heart. A notably great scene comes from comedy powerhouses Sanjeev Bhaskar and Meera Sayal as Jack's parents, one of many early moments that makes what is to follow look promising. It is a huge shame, therefore, that Yesterday slides off the rails, leaving behind its interesting premise to settle as a forgettable and frankly quite dull romcom that feels like lesser work from both Boyle and Curtis. There's one particular sequence where the film makes a horrifically misjudged turn and, from then on, meanders and warbles to a barely conclusive and unsatisfying ending. Himesh Patel leads the cast as Jack and one can't fault his utter commitment to what I'm sure will be a career-boosting role. However, despite this, Jack is a fundamentally unlikeable character; throughout the film he lumbers and sulks his way from screen-to-screen to the point that one wonders why we care about him in the first place. The same is true of the rest of the cast; Kate McKinnon does her best as a one-dimensional corporate music manager whose comedic novelty swiftly wears off and even James, who charmed the roof off in last year's Mamma Mia sequel, is given very little to work with. I hate to say that the real problem here seems to lie in Curtis' writing; whilst there are a few funny moments and characters (Joel Fry is superb as the hapless Rocky echoing Rhys Ifans in a better Curtis outing Notting Hill), largely there's very little to Yesterday that gives in any sort of kick. The 'what if' scenario that actually could be interesting seems always to be playing second place to Patel and James' bland love story, a 120-min will-they-won't-they... despite the fact we know they will. After the first third, there are occasional beads of hilarity and heart but these are largely lost within a sea of banal aimlessness that feels like borderline laziness on behalf of its creators who we know can do so much more. Equally, there are other aspects of Yesterday that don't play in its favour; the jukebox soundtrack is limited and underplayed, the editing choices are bizarre and the graphic effects tragically tacky. That is not to say that Yesterday doesn't have its moments; Patel's rendition of the titular hit early on is an empathetically portrayed sequence and a scene featuring a leading Beatle is beautifully poignant. Plus there are some brilliant supporting performances from the likes of Bhaskar, Sayal and Fry. In fact, it is these faint glimmers of what Yesterday could have been that make the end result even more disappointing. In the end, the clever premise is left behind in favour of a cliched, muddled and overlong summer romcom that won't go down in history like the Beatles any time soon.",5

The idea to make a movie about what if 'The Beatles' never existed and someone woke up in a world seemingly to be the only person on Earth to have remembered who 'The Beatles' were was brilliant.

From start to finish I found myself singing along with 'Jack' (not loud) as he sung Beatle songs for the first time to people who never heard of the Beatles , even thru the end of the credits.

I'm apart of the problem. They marketed the film towards Beatles fans,millennials etc and I took the bait. 99% of the humor in this film falls flat. They are base level observational, cringy, pandering to millenial humor. There were literally two jokes I laughed at and that was it. The characters are messily written especially Lily James character. She contradicted herself many times and made so many stupid and annoying decisons. Credit where credit she did do a good performance and had some good moments but they were few and far between. Jack is ok as the lead but his character motivation is all over the place. Without much spoliers he changes his stance on stealing the Beatles songs constantly and it's quite dumbfounding.

And that's ignoring the fact that he is such a bland and uninteresting chatcter. The story is literally like every other music biopic meets romance plot and is predictable at every turn. There are an incredible amount of plot holes and lack of narrative development. They didn't care if the story made sense at all.

One star for the odd bit of humor now and then, mostly very cozy British bits like the dad asking for a sandwich or someone stealing someone's crisps.

Other than that, this was a movie that left me feeling like Marlon Brando at the end of Apocalypse Now. The horror . .. the horror!

Please understand, I'm an American male and I've been listening to the Beatles for forty-three years. I remember what it was like when you could only buy their albums on vinyl and in America they were all different. We had Beatles 65 Beatles VI, and not Beatles for Sale. But I remember how good it felt on Sunday mornings at home, listening to songs like ""Kansas City"" and ""Words of Love.""

Funny thing is, both those songs are actually not Beatle originals. ""Kansas City"" was a Little Richard song. Richard was a gay black man from Macon, Georgia. ""Words of Love"" was written by a Texan named Buddy Holly. The Beatles learned a lot from those guys. Without them the Beatles really would not have existed. Without America the Beatles would not have existed.

Yet in this movie America is bad news, a joke, a put on. And the music of the Beatles is re-invented in a sort of painless virgin-birth that excludes any vision of change, conflict, or rebellion.

God knows the Beatles could be tough on America (""Rocky Raccoon"" ""Happiness Is A Warm Gun."") But they could also be hard on women. And old people. And England. And, well, everything. It's astonishing how the makers of this film want the Beatles to be remembered -- only the softest, soppiest ballads, and barely a nod to any of the mean, hard-rocking material they did almost as well as the Rolling Stones.

So getting down to the plot, such as it was. It's great fun to see Lily James, who soared playing unforgettable dream girls like Elizabeth Bennett and Natasha Rostov, playing a forgettable girl next door type. She just is so touching in all her scenes, especially when she hears ""Yesterday"" for the first time. But it's funny because when Jack leaves her to go on his first tour, I really expected him to start singing ""If I Needed Someone."" Because he's brushing her off for the money, and he's really ice cold about it! ""If I had some more time to spend, then I guess I'd be with you my friend . . . if I needed someone!""

See how cold that song is? See how heartless? George Harrison wrote that. See, the Beatles could be cold. The Beatles could be mean. But they could also be brutally honest about their emotions. That's something this movie so does not get. Nor does it wish to!

Now look at the other side of the coin. In the oldest romantic movie cliche, when Jack is gone too long Ellie gets herself another man. Nothing wrong with that, good on her. But it's funny, when Jack sees the other guy I really expected him to get steaming mad and rush out on stage and start singing ""I'll Cry Instead"" How did John put it? ""I've got every reason on earth to be mad, cause I've just lost the only girl I had. If I could see you now, I'd try to make you sad somehow. But I can't so I'll cry instead."" See how direct that is? How it's brutally honest and direct and says what the man really feels, without any effort to act like a nice guy or leave everyone smiling? This movie so, so, does not get ""I'll Cry Instead.""

When I went to the movies yesterday to watch this yesterday, it was a big milestone in my life. All the other people in line were senior citizens, and when I said ""one senior"" the lad at the counter gave it to me without even asking my age. I felt kind of thrilled, yet sad. But this movie just made me sad. It's sad that the only people who want to see a movie about the Beatles are old people like me. It's even sadder that the vision this movie presents of the Beatles rigorously excludes about sixty percent of who they really were and what they had to say. Maybe it's just as well that young people are staying away in droves!

When I was a kid, forty years ago, there was a cheap made for TV movie in America about the Beatles' rise to fame. I'll never forget the scene at the Cavern Club, where the local kids are screaming and going crazy and the Beatles are about to go onstage for the first time with Ringo Starr as their Drummer. John Lennon is in command, and he looks out at the crowd with a cold, sneering look on his arrogant face. Then he shouts something like, ""hello, you horrible lot. Welcome to the fabulous Apollo Theater in Harlem!""

Now what did he mean by that? What point was he trying to make? Figure it out and you'll understand why YESTERDAY is such an empty experience.",3

Cliff Booth would be a guy I would want to hang out with. It's nice to see a movie about two guy friends that support one another in different facets of life. It is so much deeper than some sort of average buddy cop affair. Margo Robbie gets a shout out too. She truly embodies Sharon Tate and glows on screen. She is amazing.

I liked Brad's character the most, but Leo easily matched with his own performance. A definite see-it-in-theatres watch. Bring your sense of humor though. There are lines of dialogue and laugh out loud bits that completely satisfy your curious mind. Expect everything you would from Tarantino, but also what you wouldn't.

I gave it a perfect 10 because I forgot I was watching a nearly 3 hour film, even though it still wasn't long enough for me. I would like to see a director's cut up to an hour longer as I think this is a unique case that extra footage would only help such an already powerful story.

His latest reminds us of a bygone era of movie stars and old school filmmaking ... a once beloved industry which has been described as being on life support. There have been plenty of big screen love letters to Hollywood, but few if any, were filmed with so many personal touches and call-backs to the director's own films.

In keeping with the request from Mr. Tarantino, this review will not include any spoilers or details that might negatively impact anyone's initial viewing of the film. It's a reasonable request since the film is so unique and literally packed with nostalgia, sight gags, and historical bits and pieces - some accurate, some not so much. There is a lot to take in and process, and the full impact of the initial viewing might result in awe, shock or disgust ... and maybe even all of the above. So this will be a pretty simple overview peppered with some insight that should enhance rather than spoil the experience.

The film covers about 6 months in 1969, but in reality, it all takes place (at least what we see on screen) in 3 days. Leonardo DiCaprio (possibly his best ever performance) plays Rick Dalton, an actor who had a hit (fictional) TV western series in the 50's and 60's entitled ""Bounty Law"". Since the show ended, Rick has been unable to make the successful transition to movies. For comparison, think of Clint Eastwood, Steve McQueen and Burt Reynolds - all actors in TV westerns who found greater career success in movies. Brad Pitt (the epitome of cool) stars as Cliff Booth, Rick's stunt double, friend, driver, handyman, etc. While Rick is desperate to find the next stage of his career and fend off being forgotten, Cliff, a Vietnam vet, is accepting of his lot in life. Rick lives in a swanky Hollywood Hills home next door to hotshot director Roman Polanski and his starlet wife Sharon Tate; and Cliff lives in a trailer behind the Van Nuys Drive-In with his well-trained Rottweiler Brandy.

There are multiple parallel stories to follow, and a key one involves the aforementioned Sharon Tate. Margot Robbie nails the role and bounces about town with the energy and sweet aura that we imagine she possessed. All 3 of the lead actors - DiCaprio, Pitt, Robbie - have knockout scenes that I'd love to be able to discuss, but I'm not sure how without giving away too much. What I can say is that each of these three talented actors prove that movie stars still exist.

This is Tarantino's 9th film as a director (he counts the 2-part KILL BILL as one film), and he claims he will stop making films after number 10. There are multiple features we can count on in a QT film, and a ridiculously deep supporting cast is one. Going through each of the characters played by actors you will recognize would take a page and a half, so I'll cover only a few here. Margaret Qualley is a scene stealer as Pussycat, one of the Manson family girls. You likely remember her from the recent ""Fosse/Verdon"" or ""The Leftovers"", and here she fully embraces the hippie look and spirit. Emile Hirsch plays hairdresser Jay Sebring, one of those in the house with Ms. Tate on that fateful night, and Mike Moh plays Bruce Lee so convincingly that I was momentarily confused when he took off his sunglasses. Also making appearances are some Tarantino regulars: Kurt Russell (as a stunt coordinator and narrator), Michael Madsen (as an actor), and Bruce Dern as George Spahn (a late replacement after Burt Reynolds passed away). Others of note include Maya Hawke (Uma Thurman's daughter), Austin Butler (recently cast in the title role of Baz Luhrmann's Elvis biopic) as Tex Watson, Rumer Willis (Bruce's daughter) as actress Joanna Pettet, Damian Lewis as Steve McQueen, Al Pacino as agent Marvin Schwarzs, Dakota Fanning as Squeaky Fromme, and the late Luke Perry as actor Wayne Maunder (""Lancer""). 90 year old Clu Gulager (""The Virginian"", THE LAST PICTURE SHOW) makes an appearance, and Nicholas Hammond (Friedrich from THE SOUND OF MUSIC) tears into his role with gusto as director Sam Wanamaker. There is even a TV Guide cover featuring the late great character actor Andrew Duggan (""Lancer""). Some of these, and many more, are like cameos, but it's still fascinating to see the faces.

1969 was 50 years ago, and Tarantino does a remarkable job of recreating the look of Sunset Boulevard, Hollywood Boulevard, Cielo Drive, and studio backlots. Much credit goes to Production Designer Barbara Ling and Set Decorator Nancy Haigh (frequent Coen Brothers collaborator and an Oscar winner for BUGSY). Arianne Phillips does a tremendous job with the costumes that look natural for the time period, and not like something right off the wardrobe racks. Three-time Oscar winning Cinematographer Robert Richardson (HUGO, THE AVIATOR, JFK) is back for his 6th Tarantino film, and he captures the look and feel and vibe of a time that is so personal to the director.

It's been three and a half years since THE HATEFUL EIGHT, Tarantino's most recent film, and probably his worst received. This one is clearly personal as it captures the time and place that he fell in love with movies. The dichotomy of rising starlet and fading cowboy as neighbors is a brilliant way to make a point about times changing. This was a time of transition in the United States - a new culture was upon us, and whatever innocence remained, was surely snuffed out on a hot August night in 1969. As usual, his use of music serves a purpose. We are treated to Roy Head, The Royal Guardsmen, and Paul Revere and the Raiders, among others. QT also shows us plenty of bare feet (another trademark). What is unusual is that the film lacks the trademark mass dialogue. This one kind of meanders ... right up until it doesn't.

Quentin Tarantino is a living, breathing film geek (that's a compliment) who has earned the right to make the movies he wants to make. This one took him a lifetime to live, 5 years to write, and it will take you 161 minutes to watch. It was warmly received at Cannes, but no one can expect to ""catch"" everything Mr. Tarantino has served up in one viewing. That said, one viewing will likely be one too many for quite a few folks (especially many under 40 who have no recollection of this Hollywood). Some will categorize this as an overindulgent nostalgia trip for movie nerds. And they are likely correct. But for those of us who complain that too many movies are remakes, re-treads and comic books, there is no denying Tarantino delivers a unique and creative viewing experience - and it's not meant for everyone.",8

I especially loved the true-grit nature of Brad Pitt's character (and his dog). And kudos to the rest of the cast, including DiCaprio, who flexed his considerable acting talent, and also to the young lady (Julia Butters) who played an eight-year-old actress on one of the sets.

The music, costumes, makeup, sets, and locations totally nailed the era. The whole crew did a great job.

I will watch this movie again; I loved it that much.

(BTW, I don't know if everyone in the audience 'got' the film. My advice, if you're not super familiar with the Charles Manson story, is to watch the 2004 Helter Skelter TV film or read the book Helter Skelter.)",10

I've been a Quentin Tarantino fan since, well, Reservoir Dogs. Amid his trademark over-the-top violence and gore, I have always felt he treats the art with a respect that's often lost in controversy. His execution of heartfelt homage is so authentic that it becomes his biggest criticism, and to the less astute, is often dismissed as blatant theft.

Once Upon a Time In Hollywood is the homage of all homages. Critics are calling this Tarantino's ""love letter to Hollywood"", but in reality it's much, much more. This letter addresses a Hollywood that's no longer recognizable, and that melancholy is woven into the fabric of this film. While there is the requisite violence, witty banter, and unpredictable outcomes, this is probably the most mature and intelligent Quentin Tarantino film yet. It also deviates from the Tarantino template by remaining somewhat linear. With a runtime of just over two hours and forty minutes, the pacing is artfully throttled, allowing the audience to take in the authentic and painstakingly detailed scenery. The period music drives the narrative but never becomes a music video. The performances are flawless. Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt will deservedly receive accolades for their performances as the main characters, but honestly there is not a single weak performance among the ensemble. And lastly, the subject matter: I was admittedly apprehensive about how the events of August 8, 1969 would be handled. While no one would be surprised to see these heinous acts glorified or even caricatured, Tarantino continues to be unpredictable. At the risk of spoiling the plotline, I'll just say this is handled tastefully and even respectfully, yet true to the classic Tarantino flair.

Once Upon a Time in Hollywood demonstrates a more mellowed Quentin Tarantino touch but it's far from a departure. I suspect audiences that normally can't stomach the assaulting violence and shock of the Tarantino brand may very well enjoy this film.",10

 Once upon a time in Hollywood seems to be Tarantino's most mature, laid back and easy going film. And I mean maturity as in the maturity of Tarantino as a filmmaker. This is very different than every other film of his, it doesn't rely on shock value (until the end anyway), it doesn't have super hardcore violence for the most part, it also doesn't have high tension sequences that we've come to expect from Tarantino, but that's doesn't disappoint you because that high tension galore isn't needed here. It's a comedy about two friends. A fading actor and his stuntman in the aftermath of the golden age of cinema, trying to fit in, in a rapidly changing industry. What I love about this is Tarantino's love for filmmaking, films and the experience of going to the cinema is oozing in this. You can just tell he LOVES what he does and he LOVES going to the movies. The ""quirky"" kind of tone, the witty, fantastic dialogue is all still there and it is top tier Tarantino. The performances from Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio are incredible, such great chemistry, they elevate the film in every scene they are together, Margot Robbie plays Sharon Tate beautifully. And she did a great job respectfully portraying an actress who was murdered tragically. My biggest gripe with the film is that Tarantino didn't use any of his signature high tension, downright uncomfortable sequences regarding the Manson cult. I would've liked to experiences that eeriness when he introduced us to the cult in the film, but he just brushed it off. Other than that the film is incredible artistic, stylized; the soundtrack is amazing, it works incredible well while cliff booth is driving around the night time in LA. It sets the mood perfectly. This is also gonna be one of, if not THE most rewatchable film Tarantino has ever made. Just great. I loved it so much, and I suspect I'll love it even more as time goes on. It's incredible Tarantino made a film with almost no structured narrative and you still come out of it thinking ""that was fantastic"" ; the last shot of the film is so beautiful, and kind of sad if you read up on the Sharon Tate murder. I loved Tarantino's twist to what happened, it made me wish that only if that had what happened in real life :(",9

This movie like Pulp Fiction, is not about the plot. Pulp Fiction has no plot as well. Once upon a time in Hollywood is about the characters and about situations. You need to have some culture in movies to like this one. Of course is too long for if you started to watch movies after 2005. It s obvious that you never seen the old classic movies. Then you wondering why cinema has changed and we dont have good movies anymore.

I remember tv of that era: weekly westerns and crime dramas like Gunsmoke or Perry Mason. Shows that had guest stars who were usually familiar actors from movies or older shows. It was a love story about friendship and honor. What others said was too much jumping around wasn't really paying attention. It clearly stated the dates of what was happening. It was highlighting moments in each character's lives to convey their emotions in addition to tying up the end. And I believe it was a fairytale, hence the title ""Once Upon A Time..."".",9

Believe the 10 star reviews. OUATIH exceeds every expectation with its mind-blowing attention to detail, superb dialogue, incredible performances and, most of all, its overwhelming love for the movies. Tarantino's illustrious career has culminated in this stylishly nostalgic journey that takes us back to everything great about the 60s. Every detail of this period is done to a tee; and it's in all the most minute aspects, whether it be a can of dog food or a radio station, where this film is elevated to masterpiece status.

Remember when Jules and Vincent instantly became one of cinemas classic duos in Pulp Fiction? You can now confidently say the same thing about Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth - Leo and Brad give performances of a lifetime as these endearing, hilarious and, at times, even heart-rending characters. They're joined by a beyond stellar supporting group that's filled beautifully by the likes of Margot Robbie, Timothy Oliphant, Al Pacino, (the late) Luke Perry, Emile Hirsch and many more who all breathe life into this wonderfully unique and engaging story.

All in all, it's a fantastic dive into the Golden Age that's fulls of twists at every turn and shines even brighter in its quieter moments when it's love for everything old cinema is at the forefront of its telling. At its core, it's invigorated by a guy whose talent as a storyteller is exceeded only by his sheer love for film and that is Mr. Quentin Tarantino. And for anyone who thinks the runtime could/should have been shorter, remember that QT was trying to make many of us who had never grown up/experienced that era (like myself) feel close to it. This meant every seemingly trivial scene/moment's sole purpose was to create as authentic an atmosphere as he could've conjured up.

It's as ambitious a vision as one could muster and he truly nailed it with flying colors, creating a fairytale that enthrals you in ways you never knew were possible. I hope he's lying when he says he's ready to call it quits but I'll be damned if this isn't the best way possible to go out. It's official ol buddy... we got a darn frickin classic on our hands!",10

It doesn't really have a plot ... it's kind of like a ""day in the life of a fading Hollywood TV actor"", but still it's just fascinating to watch. The acting, cinematography and production values for capturing the late 60s (and really ... dawn of the 70s) are about as good as you'll ever see. It's just art.

And when it comes the ending ... wow. Especially if you know a bit of history. It's intense and amazing and I'll just leave it at that.

That said, it is a little male-biased by modern standards, but it's capturing the mentality of a different time period. DiCaprio and Pitt play two wildly different characters that you just want to keep watching to see they do next. They will quite possibly win Oscars for their performances -- and Tarantino will no doubt be up for best director, best original screenplay and best film.

If you enjoy Tarantino's moviemaking style - the dialog, the visuals, the period details and, yes ... the violence ... this is a must see. It's almost 2 and 3/4 hours - but I would have gladly stayed longer.

BTW, if you stay a minute into the end-credits, there's a post credit scene followed by a fun radio (audio-only) contest commercial.",

The sets look amazing, the costuming is unique (and although I didn't grow up in the 1960s, it looked period accurate?) and flashy. It might be an overused phrase, but I was transported into this world filled with dreams and imagination yet had so little substance. The movie does a great job of wowing you with how cool Hollywood was yet also showing the not-so-pretty parts of the love child movement that was taking over (there's a bunch of shots of dirty feet....because why?). Its fantastic work with the visuals and the cinematography that looks fantastic, even the TV productions that Dalton is ""acting"" in are shot in an interesting and captivating. I expected nothing less but I still left the movie impressed.

I didn't know a movie about a famous set of murders could be so comedic? This movie is part drama, part thriller but its almost a slice-of-life set in late 1960s Hollywood. The movie is more about the characters, there isn't much emphasis on the plot and you're more just spending time with these characters as they float through their lives. There were points where I just forgot that time was even progressing, it seems like it could take place over just a couple of days. I was okay with this but it made the movie feel almost like we were watching a dream. I didn't have a problem with this decision but it did leave the movie kind of directionless, I was enjoying the ride but there were a couple of times where I was asking myself, where is this movie going? When you've got such a funny and colourful cast of characters, you're going to be having fun either way but Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood operates on its own wavelength instead of following the conventional.

This movie is full of amazing actors, do you think I'm going to complain about the acting? DiCaprio and Pitt are excellent together and apart, I'm just impressed at how funny DiCaprio is when he wants to be, when did that become a thing? They're equally good even though I thought Pitt gave the best performance. Margot Robbie was really good but how she was used in this was a weird choice. Its not a ""cameo"" but she's separated so much from everyone else except Hirsch that I thought she was almost set up as a metaphor for innocence or an allegory for the dream-like lustre that Hollywood possesses. She's really good but I can't say she stole the show, she has little dialogue and is just dancing through a lot of her scenes. You have Margaret Qualley next with the most screen time? She's very bubbly and brings some levity. My next favourite supporting performances came from Mike Moh, Maya Hawke and Timothy Olyphant who are all good and funny in their appearances.

So while the movie is largely pretty upbeat with occasional dark moments, the ending is very much what you picture a climax in a Tarantino production. It goes bananas and even if you know the story of Manson family, it doesn't go where you expect. Although I enjoyed the rest of the movie, it was both fitting and it injected some tension. The creative team knows how to build things up and things ramp up big time in those final few scenes. Despite the movie mostly being comedic, I was surprised how worried I was for our main players and that much more surprise when things went a different direction. Minus there being some typical over-the-top beats, it was an excellent capper to this movie and it helped Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood gain some more of Tarantino's flavour.

I left the theatre in a bit of a daze after seeing this one. I enjoyed almost every aspect of it, the writing, directing, acting, costuming and makeup and even the pace were all taught and well done on the whole. Did I dig every single aspect of it? No but if that's your benchmark for an excellent movie, you're probably disappointed whenever you go to the movies. I liked this better than The Hateful Eight and I would put it up against any other film in Tarantino's recent output. I'd like to see it again to work out some of my deeper questions about it but for now I'd definitely recommend it to Tarantino fans and newcomers alike. Its one of Quentin's more accessible movies and while it does have really violent moments, other than the ending, its not too bad throughout. Some of the references definitely went over my head but I don't think that will interrupt your enjoyment of the movie. Despite the long run time, I thought this movie breezed by me and I'm happy to rate it at a 9/10.",9

Again as is common in any film of Tarantino's is the cast is always all star and a memorable ensemble and it seems the acting and chemistry is always in top form. And this might be the director's finest film to date for it's look back in time to a memorable yesteryear era!

""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood"" is set in 1969 at the height and end of Hollywood's golden age an era of free spirits and cultural uprising. It follows the life of one Rick Booth(in fine form from Leonardo DiCaprio) a past his prime and faded TV actor who now struggles even to get small parts in TV westerns, and Booth seems hopeless yet he's still friends with his buddy and partner in crime that being his stunt double Cliff Booth(Brad Pitt). The two burn plenty of midnight oil together still a ray of light is found when Rick gets a second chance and a rebirth by doing international pictures and marrying an Italian beauty.

In somewhat of a wild card and subplot story Dalton's neighbor is the sexy and young actress Sharon Tate(Margot Robbie) who spices and lightens up the screen as a young star in the making.

Strays away from past-QT excessiveness and heavy dialogue. Once Upon A Time In Hollywood is soft, light and even. It's an expression of a man maturing as a filmmaker who narrows emphasis on the right elements. Not much more can be said about Pitt and DiCaprio. We follow their trails in a world so intricately and subtly detailed for them. The movie almost doesn't feel real, a humbled Tarantino was going for whimsical, beautiful charm. Words I never suspected to describe his work. A refreshing surprise.

Of course it isn't for everyone. This is a 'type' of film that doesn't rely on plot. I found myself wanting to spend many more hours entranced in it. Length is a gripe which can be said for every Tarantino picture. Is it a drawn-out drag? No chance. I can name you thousands of slower films than this one.

I enjoyed the movie thoroughly. A well crafted aspect was how some characters including Sharon Tate are utilized. Sharon represents the life Rick wants to have. So in Rick's eyes, Sharon is a dream, a facade and that is how Tarantino shoots her. We follow her around like we are a ghost observing her from a distance. Tarantino births an arc we dive in with just the right touch. The world is mesmerizingly enlivened this way to serve Cliff and Rick. Magnifique.

Once Upon A Time In Hollywood is not trying to be a masterpiece and it likes it that way, it's going for something better. Tarantino is not coming from a place of egoism. The core exploration is centred around indulgence, which is a depiction, not a representation.

Notable elements are the costumes, sets and endearing cinematography. Check it out if you are looking for an ethereal / genuine experience at the cinemas. I would not recommend if you're going with demands in a movie that demands nothing ... And we ask, who is self indulgent?",10

For a long time he had a scrawny build and a youthful face. Like most moviegoers, I didn't regard him seriously as a tough guy until I saw ""The Departed"" in 2006. ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" and ""The Revenant"" followed, and they cemented his place as a rugged leading man throwback. He does not disappoint in this movie as Rick Dalton when the scenes demand it. Brad Pitt, who was always convincing in such a role since the start of his career, plays his character Cliff Booth to perfection. It's probably my favorite Pitt performance other than ""Twelve Monkeys.""

 Director Quentin Tarantino designed this film in a way that each scene serves the function of creating likeability and credibility for its characters, not necessarily advancing the plot. And in this day and age of ""toxic masculinity"" and when studios want five foot tall women to take over men's roles, he made many bold moves. Dalton and Booth aren't afraid or ashamed to kick ass and take names. Yet, unlike Tarantino's previous work in which a head exploded when it took a round from a small caliber pistol or torrents of blood gushed from minor wounds, the violence isn't cartoonish.

 Yes, the movie is a love letter to Hollywood, and people who have lived in L.A. probably appreciate it more than outsiders. There are references to and visuals of Forest Lawn Cemetery, Burbank Boulevard, Toluca Lake, Van Nuys, Panorama City, etc. that caused my brain to smile during the film-- especially because these places that I've seen ten million times in person were shown in a '60s style. A meta reference that caused my audience to chuckle: at one point Margot Robbie's Sharon Tate character sees spotlights oscillating at ""the porn theater"" down the street from a restaurant. ""What is going on at the porn theater?"" ""A premiere."" ""Porn theaters have premieres?"" In fact, it's The New Beverly Cinema, the theater that Tarantino now owns and that played porn films during the '60s and '70s.

I'm ashamed to admit that, like most Americans, although I'm very familiar with Charles Manson's history, I knew little about Sharon Tate and almost nothing about Jay Sebring. Tarantino did an excellent job of making them three dimensional people rather than background characters who served the plot. Ironically, if anyone is a background character whose brief appearance serves the plot, it's Manson himself. Such direction honors Sebring and Tate.

I have one complaint about this film. With all due (immense) respect for Tarantino, I agree with critics who stated that Robbie was underused. A couple of years ago I stated on this blog that ""I, Tonya"" was the best film of 2017, so I've known for a while that she is a phenomenal talent. YET I personally don't know how her role could have been expanded without blemishing the film. She did an outstanding job in this film, especially with her facial expressions at a movie theater, yet Tate's real life story has almost nothing to do with Dalton and Booth's fictional lives. It's like if the Angels used Mike Trout in an optimal pinch hitting role in the sixth or seventh inning of five consecutive games, and he hit grand slams every time. No fan would want to interfere with that streak, yet you would think that his team is severely unserved with him on the bench for most of the game.

I rate this film 9 of 10 stars. It's my third favorite Tarantino film, and it caused me to break my rule about not applauding in a theater unless someone who worked on the film is in attendance. I applauded during its climax, and the odds are good that you will as well.",9

Once Upon a Time in Hollywood may not be Tarantino's best work, but it damn sure comes close to taking that spot. The directing is phenomenal, Quentin Tarantino exquisitely shows once again why he is one of this generation's auteurs. The performances from everyone, especially Leo and Brad, are extraordinary and the writing is superb, as were given dialogue that only Tarantino could pull off. If any other director/writer tried the conversations he works in this film; then half the audience would probably have fallen asleep. This also may be Tarantino's funniest film yet, and because of that, it made for one of my favorite theatre experiences of the year. I don't think I've laughed that hard at a movie as I did with Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. However, with all that said what may be the most impressive thing about this film is the cinematography and set pieces. Tarantino does a fantastic job transporting the audience into this world, and I never felt for a moment that this wasn't Hollywood during the '60s.

Nevertheless, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is not perfect, it's pretty damn close to it, but I do have an issue with the film, and that's pacing. Throughout the film, multiple scenes could be removed from the final cut and wouldn't affect the outcome of the movie at all. While other (necessary) parts of the film are way longer, then they have any right to be. Unnecessary scenes, info, and dialogue are my biggest gripe with Tarantino as a writer. You could, however, look on the other side and say that those ""unnecessary"" scenes are quite entertaining, and they usually are, and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is no exception. Although it has those elongated dialogues and unnecessary scenes, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is still pretty entertaining at being gratuitous so it somewhat (not entirely) makes up for it.

In a year full of unoriginal and disappointing films, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood truly stands out from the pack. Tarantino's ninth film is not without its faults, but what film isn't? Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, elegantly displays why Quentin Tarantino is one of the greatest filmmakers ever and is easily the best film of 2019. An obvious recommend.",10

This portion of the movie doesn't have a straight plot to follow and some viewers may not appreciate it. However, I would defend this segment as a stroll in the 1960's through movies and television. This is really a movie about movies/stars/Hollywood after all. It is nonetheless, very well put together.

There is a generous portion of hippie punching, degradation and abuse (to put it lightly). Some viewers may not appreciate this.

There aren't any strong female leads but Margo Robbie is excellent as happy, go-lucky starlet Sharon Tate. Some viewers may not appreciate this. I'm sure there will be no shortage of woke outrage that Robbie/Tate isn't deep thinking and.. 'powerful' (because you know, it's 2019).

The key takeaway here: ""Once Upon a Time.."" is a buddy movie and it does feel targeted a bit toward men. There is definitely strong violence and a lot of derogatory language... in other words, a Tarantino movie.

Do not look for real life truth as with any of his films, which is hard to do since real people are characters mixed into Tarantino's bag of Pulp Fiction. Remember that it is about the interactions, they in totality reveal the story he is telling. Redemption lives within the walls of an accumulation of mundane tasks, but in this case those tasks are the glamour of a fading lead actor trying to get through what to common people is a mid life crisis. This movie is about everyday themes within a construct of trivial pursuits. But on the flip side they aren't trivial to Rick or Cliff. Does Dalton's comeback even matter while people from the Ranch are preying on the same ideals of perceived vanity? Is it vanity or just being a human no matter what your career is? The fabric of this film is woven by all the ingredients Quentin likes to brew, but from angles you didn't know you wanted to see. It is a long epic with scenes that make you wonder about their significance when they are really just nostalgic placemats upon which the dinner will be served. But he takes his time making it.

I absolutely loved the scenes that were Rick Dalton (DiCaprio) acting in the movies he stars in. They were extremely intense or hilariously funny but so enjoyable. That being said, what really puts this movie ahead more than any other is the performances from DiCaprio and Pitt. They are both hilarious and then in the next scene they are making you tear up or feel their emotions at a whole new level. DiCaprio has to be an actor playing an actor who occasionally is playing a role in tv shows or movies which is extremely difficult and he blows it out of the water.

Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood is a complete ode to sixties films and television, jammed full of nostalgia. The movie looks great, both colored and shot to evoke the era. Costume and setting is strongly nostalgic.

Yet again Tarantino shows a true mastery of film with inspired editing, music and camera work.

This is the closest the director has gotten to a pure comedy with some strongly crafted bits and dialogue. With his emphasis on more intense action-oriented films these past few years, it's nice to see him returning to a more let's-have-fun-with-this tone that he had in Pulp Fiction and his segment in the anthology film Four Rooms. (That short contribution is tragically underexposed. You should really see it if you get the chance.) As with most Tarantino films, he does a great job of catching you off-guard at moments with the plot.

Needless to say that Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt are great actors, but they really knock it of the park here with the former as a comically over-the-top insecure actor and the latter as his cool, confident stunt man/chauffer/go-for/friend.

As had been his habit for some of his films, Tarantino succeeds despite his more questionable impulses. This includes but is not limited to frequent use of the b-word in regard to Hispanic Americans, the controversial use of Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie), Jay Sebring (Emile Hirsch), the Manson family, and Roman Polanski (Rafal Zawierucha). (Yeah, Polanski isn't in this or say that much, and his infamous crime doesn't factor into this, but it's hard not to think about it when he's mentioned. It doesn't help that Tarantino has defended him in the past. Yeah, Tarantino recently apologized, but you can't help wondering if he was sincere or did it for self-preservation due to the MeToo movement.)

Running at two hours and forty-one minutes, the second act is longer than it needs to be. A lot of the Sharon Tate scenes don't really add anything and I kind of felt that the role was so light that it wasn't worth an actress of Robbie's caliber.

This movie is an open range for Tarantino to spread his knowledge of film and television history. Some of it is rather interesting, but there is just so much that it feels self-indulgent and awkward.

Yeah, if you're not a fan of Tarantino and thinks he goes too far, I don't think this'll change your mind. For everyone else: I personally think this is one of his top five pictures.",10

I just got done watching it and enjoyed it. There's not really much to say about the plot that hasn't already been understood by the publicity, but a few things stand out.

DiCaprio gives a stellar performance as a Western aging actor on the downswing of his career, with many memorable acting scenes, some where he is acting within his acting.

Pitt is also very good in his role as DiCaprio's stunt double. Robbie is excellent as Sharon Tate, and the other smaller roles are all played good enough.

The movie takes its time in building up, and I've seen some people complain it was slow or boring, but I'll be honest: while I noticed a couple of scenes dragged a little bit, I rather enjoyed it, and it didn't bother me, for the most part.

I liked some of Tarantino's creative choices and nuances a lot, but I did feel like there may have been a few opportunities missed to make it even better. However, with limited time and editing reasons, surely only so much could make it into the movie.

I wouldn't mind seeing more of Cliff Booth and Rick Dalton's adventures through Hollywood in 1969. This one took the audience through Bruce Lee and the infiltration of the Hippies, but it seems like there could be even more to their stories.

It's a solid film, and like one person pointed out: in an age of comic books and remakes, because the movie suffices on all levels, it was a nice experience to see something original.",8

It really has no plot whatsoever, it's just kind of a chill movie. You kind of hang with these characters for a couple of days and watch 1969 Hollywood. It is almost like watching a documentary of 1969 Hollywood. I feel this maybe the most grounded Tarantino flick yet.

The acting is top notch. Leo gives the best performance of his entire career. It is the first performance without any signs of a normal ""Leo Performance"". Brad Pitt steals the show in every scene. He IS CLIFF BOOTH. Everyone else does a magnificent job. Shout out to whoever played Bruce Lee because, WOW, they were fantastic.

This movie will divide a lot of people. It has no real story, and it's more of just watch these guys do life. The only part with actual story is the last 15 mins, which is when the most TARANTINO parts occur. For the most part though, the movie is kind of just, watch these two likeable guys do stuff. It's entertaining, and never really a drag. I know a lot of people didn't like it as much because it has no real plot. People say like Pulp Fiction is no plot, but that isn't true. This movie. This movie has no plot, but it's still entertaining. I think it's the least Tarantino, tarantino film, and it's why it was truly refreshing.

I loved this movie! I mean LOVED it! Not just because i'm a huge Tarantino fan, but because I was taken back in time to Hollywood 1969, when Hollywood was in its Golden age. Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth work so well together, Leo and Brad both give some of the best performances I've ever seen in film. Leo shows so much passion and love for acting when he's on screen, same goes for Brad. Margot Robbie was incredible! She gives a strong electric feel to Sharon Tate and lights up the whole movie when shes on screen. The whole cast was so well utilized. Each character feels alive and exciting!

It not only centers around real life counter-culture figures Charles Manson & Family, Sharon Tate (a strutting Barbie Doll here), Roman Polanski and hairstylist Jay Sebring (Tate's supposed lover) but the last of The Family's victims, Donald ""Shorty"" Shea, an experienced tough-guy stuntman who thought the hippie horde was taking advantage of employer George Spahn at his formerly active Spahn Movie Ranch, where Manson and company made their very own playground, ultimately setting stage for the ""Helter Skelter Murders"" that infamously included an 8-month pregnant Tate...

For people expecting ONCE UPON A TIME IN HOLLYWOOD to be the kind of bloody thriller Tarantino's known for, the dark and forbidding suspenseful stuff begins halfway through in a pivotal scene where Brad Pitt's Cliff Booth, a world-weary stunt man like Shea, checks up on old friend/acquaintance Spahn (Bruce Dern adequately replacing Burt Reynolds) to find out what the deal is with the hippie freeloaders...

But Pitt plays anything but a victim, built into such an indestructible bad ass he lives in a grungy LETHAL WEAPON style trailer, owns a pitbull and even gets the best of Bruce Lee, who, surprisingly since Tarantino worships Asian Kung Fu flicks, is a pretentious blowhard boob, and not even a decent fighter! Which can feel downright blasphemous from a filmmaker to his core-fans that both worship the legendary icon. But like everything else, it all makes its own bizarre/offbeat sense by the end...

Which shouldn't be spoiled except to say that even if you did know ""how"" things go down, the ""why"" is hilariously violent, unique and original despite initially seeming tacked on and rushed (following a sudden six-month lapse). Which might be because spending so much meantime with stunt-double Cliff Booth and the ""has-been"" actor he doubles for, runs errands for, and hangs out with, is the best thing going in a film where Tarantino hasn't seemed as loose and relaxed with since KILL BILL...

Perhaps it's because the usual endless string of pop culture references don't feel so contrived since the movie takes place where most of them originated. And in that, 1969 Los Angeles comes to life in predictably nostalgic, groovy grandeur. But with all the prolonged (and sometimes overlong) existential driving around town and hanging around movie sets, it's really more about characters than the time period they exist in. That alone puts HOLLYWOOD miles past INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS, DJANGO UNCHAINED and THE HATEFUL EIGHT, which all overdosed on their own genre-driven style over substance...

For this is a much simpler tale, and a buddy flick to boot. Tarantino even compared his handsome duo to Robert Redford and Paul Newman... and yet, these particular buddies are hardly together at all. While Booth takes his aforementioned stroll through the bad-vibey Spahn Ranch (ironically staged like a HIGH NOON type showdown), faded star Rick Dalton makes the best of making the transition from playing the hero on his own bygone Cowboy TV series to becoming typecast (warned by an Al Pacino cameo) as a villain in everyone else's: Giving Leonardo DiCaprio a chance to truly enjoy himself in a Tarantino role...

And what really works about Leo's Dalton is that he's... well... an actor, and in that, somewhat of a pussy. Unlike his macho double, he only wins or loses fights based on whatever script he's working really hard trying to be convincing in. Providing a comfortably suited, down-to-earth niche for the A-list DiCaprio, who often chooses roles far too big for his britches. In other words, he doesn't seem to be striving for an Oscar, or trying to become the next Anthony Hopkins (many leading men want to be character-actors, but very few are both at the same time)...

As for fellow Oscar-winning success story, Quentin Tarantino, his directorial presence is surely felt, especially with the random flashbacks and expository filler to remind the audience why this and that is important right now as it's happening, again... plus the fact no one else would make such a deliberately pulsating jukebox of a film about films...

But there's also a feeling he's holding just-enough back so to, for the first time in decades, let his characters fill in the more subtle yet detailed moments that make RESERVOIR DOGS, PULP FICTION and especially JACKIE BROWN so fun to watch, again and again...

In striving for a perfectly good ride, Tarantino's ONCE UPON A TIME IN HOLLYWOOD doesn't suffer from trying too-hard for epic greatness...

Sometimes pretty good can turn out pretty great.",9

DiCaprio and Pitt had great chemistry together, and the comedy was very strong at certain parts. Of course, DiCaprio and Pitt do an incredible job in this movie as always. They play very well off of eachother, as their characters are unique in their own ways. As well, Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate added a great touch to the historical backdrop of the film. There does not seem to be just one central plot, so the movie really just feels like a collection of relevant scenes. Movies like these feel more like an experience than just an average blockbuster.

But it is overfilled in a pointless manner. The movie tries to feed off of itself going nowhere for 2 hours.

From the casting, to the music to the sets, the dialog and of course the story. This movie is a beautiful homage to Hollywood that should be nominated for many Oscars. Having grown up around L.A. at that time, Tarantino made the location for this story as important as any actor in the film and gave it the complete feel of the period. There is no doubt he intimately knows and loves Hollywood - the city and the industry - with all of its flaws, and this movie shows it.

There is so much packed into this film, I will definitely be watching it again. I don't know how Tarantino can move so effortlessly between comedy and drama, but he is the best ever at doing it.

With a filmography that includes Pulp Fiction and Inglorious Basterds. Once Upon Time in Hollywood both delivers in Tarantino's signature director trademarks and offers new fresh interesting ideas.

The Characters- Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth are some of the most unique and interesting characters you will ever see in a film. They are written with so much care, Tarantino created characters who have a specific personality. From scene to scene, the characters act and behave differently. Rick is a very insecure and struggling actor. He sometime speaks with a stutter, depending on who he's with. Cliff on the other hand is a more laid back character, quite the difference from Rick. He's also a character you wouldn't want to make angry. The rest of the supporting characters all work in there respective roles, usually interacting with Rick or Cliff.

The Dialogue- A famous Tarantino trademark. Of course if you want to create good characters, you must write good dialogue. Tarantino delivers in this category, with his distinct and memorable dialogue. Every scene is handled with extreme care and precession. The jokes are well thought out and timed. No doubt one the strongest aspects of the film.

The Story/Themes- Once Upon a Time in Hollywood tells great story and is filled with fascinating themes. The struggle of being an actor, while dealing with a struggling career. Like typecasting, missed acting roles, and the anxiety. There's a scene when Rick is reading a book and he realizes the similarities between the books main character and himself. Something that film can do to its audience. I wouldn't call the film a straight up satire, but it definitely has satire themes. Also a great social message.

The Cinematography/Editing- Robert Richardson and Fred Raskin just work so well. The scenes are effective because every shot and cut have to work seamlessly. This is a film where you can watch scene by scene and with every shot and cut, it will just work. Major aspect in storytelling in my opinion.

The Acting- DiCaprio, Pitt, Robbie, Qualley, Pacino, Olyphant, and the rest of the cast, do an amazing job. Despite some of the characters get less screen time than others, they are all equally memorable. Huge accomplishment by the actors and Tarantino as a writer.

Once Upon Time in Hollywood is one the best films ever made. A film that can be entertaining and interesting to it's audience. My favorite Tarantino film.",10

The two A-list leads are our heroes! Bravo to Hollywood for building-up the 'hero worship' genre and to Tarantino for grabbing-on to it and faithfully stoking it for such a satisfying climax! Pitt deserves another Oscar nod for just being the golden-haired, low-key, stoic hero who separates what's important from what is not, and is just what we need at a time when everything else seems to he crumbling around us. Simultaneously, Tarantino glorifies the peppy pretty girls, the free spirits of the era, the mediocre TV and film efforts, and a sampling of iconic movie theaters of the time (and an excellent portrayal of the automotive mediocrity), while driving us down memory lane.

The visuals are absolutely enchanting. Fast, colorful, and distinct. Something Sony Animation always nails is how each character has a pronounced look and movement. With the various kinds of Spider-Men and Marvel villains featured in this story, the animators went all out to give them a unique identity. Notably in this case are Spider-Man Noir, Peni Parker, and Spider-Ham. Noir, whose universe takes place in 1930s New York, boasts a dark, shadowy vibe similar to Sin City, Peni Parker has a bubbly anime look, and Spider-Ham is a bouncy, eccentric cartoon character who takes full advantage of his absurd existence to deliver some of the film's best laughs. Even with these different identities, the film slows down to balance their character in a serious nature. Heck, one of the most hard-hitting, poignant lines is spoken by Spider-Ham, the breakout comedic relief.

Miles and a majority of characters share the same art style. I really enjoy the blend of 3D models with traditional 2D movement. It's very appealing to watch and it seamlessly matches the comic book theme. I also appreciate the stylization of certain villains. Kingpin is a character I don't think was portrayed accurately outside of the comics, just appearing as a generic, heavy-set bald brute, when he's really an enormous, borderline non-human tank. Kingpin looks excellent in this film, with his titanic body and small head with an intimidating grimace. He's a powerful force and a legitimately scary antagonist. Doc Ock is another example, portrayed as a brilliant, but outlandish female scientist with a psychotic passion for villainy. I didn't feel like I needed to know more about her character, she was such a fun villainess to watch. She really added to the suspense in some action sequences.

I really loved the story. I thought it was rich with charm and thrills. Granted, I did notice some familiar elements that are done to death in superhero fiction and the animation canon alike, such as surprise villain reveals and major character deaths that were obviously seen coming, and I certainly wish some characters (espeically Miles' uncle) had more screentime, but there's one fact that overshadows these flaws for me: The writing is mature. First of all, it's a Sony Animation product. If you look at this company's past work, some of it is very soulless with its marketing and panders to its audience with incessant pop culture references and juvenile comedy. Into the Spider-Verse is a welcome departure. Passion and integrity was put into this project. The writing is very grounded and treats its audience like people who want to see a genuinely captivating flick. Heck, the first third of the film is somewhat slow and nonchalant, almost like an arthouse film. I've never had such a cool, yet off-beat and engaged feeling while watching an animated film on the big screen. Nothing was forced, nothing felt out-of-place, nothing took me out of immersion. The tone and pacing is very adult, even when something excessively goofy like Spider-Ham is on-screen. It's like the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It can be dark and distressing, but lighthearted and amusing. There's a perfect balance and it never sacrifices integrity just to appeal to a niche audience. Well...there is that after-credits scene, but it was quite hilarious, so I let it pass.

That's the most I can say without spoiling a lot of the film. I want you to see this absolute marvel with your own eyes. To close, Into the Spider-Verse is everything I hoped it would be. This is a game-changer for both superhero filmmaking and animation altogether. Sleek, colorful, funny, emotional, frenetic. This film skillfully balances all these elements. There is never a moment that felt forced, it never talks down to the audience. It's a mature and stylish take on the Spider-Man mythos, and perhaps the best big-screen Spidey picture to date with some of the best animated visuals you'll ever see. I didn't have a single issue with this film. I was dazzled and moved throughout. Sony Animation, if this was your apology for The Emoji Movie, then apology goddamn accepted. Massive bravo!",10

From the presentation alone it is easily decipherable that a lot of love and passion was put into this project, making it the visual masterpiece that it is.

The story, while being mostly formulaic still does enough to satisfy new and returning audiences to the superhero genre. Combined with the visual style and presentation, Into the Spider-Verse almost feels fresh.

The biggest issue, which is more of a personal preference is the music. The film chooses today's hip hop music over an actual musical score which is understandable but still managed to take me out of the film.

Another slightly smaller issue is the epilogue, rather the way the film sets it up. Press a button and save the world. It's as silly as it sounds.

In terms of comedy, Into the Spider-Verse does a solid job, but manages to be annoying at times with its usage of Spider-Ham.

On the contrary Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is worth a watch solely for its visual style and presentation. The story is just an icing on the cake.

I've now watched this movie 10 times since getting it on digital and then Blu-ray and can safely say this is a rare, near perfect movie. This is of course my opinion and I understand why this movie isn't for everyone. Let's break down a few of the reasons why for each of these points.

If we had a list of everything that can be done to make a near perfect movie, this movie checks every box. The visuals have been talked about endlessly. It won an Oscar for them. We know they're great.

The story is great, giving us a new Spider-Man with his own skills and personality that he brings to the table. The script is tight and the production is executed with laser precision.

The voice acting is nothing short of top notch. This is easily the second best thing about this movie right behind the glorious visuals.

Shamiek Moore has quickly grown on me over the ten times I've watched this movie. His range is as good as any veteran actor and he injects so much life into Miles Morales. He IS Miles Morales.

Chris Pine did not phone in the short amount of lines he had whatsoever. Just superb casting because he and Jake Johnson sound pretty similar. And oh boy, Jake Johnson.

I never understood why JJ had gotten so wildly popular over the last several years. With this movie I finally understand. I get it. It clicked. From the moment he pops up in this movie around the 20 minute mark till the end, Jake turns in one of the voice acting performances perhaps of all time. He succeeds in bringing a past his prime Peter Parker to life and runs the gamut of dramatic, sincere, intense, but above all FUNNY. Every single comedic line never fails to make me laugh out loud. Many of the gags pop into my head while I'm working or doing something else and I'll chuckle and repeat the line to myself.

I've always enjoyed Hailee Steinfeld and she shines in this movie along with all the supporting cast.

The greatest thing about this movie also happens to be its weakness. For me, the visuals are second to none. Another review title summed it up perfectly. ""The most visually stunning movie I've ever seen"". Absolutely agree. And while it takes a little time - usually 10-15 minutes - for your eyes to adjust to the frame rate, some people apparently can not adjust to this. I can imagine how poor that viewing experience would be, too bad really. Another thing is since they didn't use actual motion blur, but instead chose to animate blur-like artifacts and tricks to make it seem like blur, or having images doubled and overlapped for a ghosting effect, it confuses some people into thinking they're seeing the 2 images of the 3D version without the glasses. And lastly, the sheer intensity of some of the rapid action sequences combined with visual aesthetic pushed just beyond the breaking point and then dialed ever so slightly back by the direction team, it's just simply too much for some people. I get that.

As far as continuity/plot holes and things of that nature, I think the movie could actually stand to be about 15-20 minutes longer. There really aren't many issues though so maybe this is just me being greedy for more visuals.

Original review: Sure, we can dissect and critique and praise using any number of words we choose, but in the end to actually appreciate truly great art, it simply must be experienced in the medium in which it was created. For this movie, it was lovingly crafted in 3D, and so in my opinion can only be fully realized by the viewer in 3D.

What is a comic book movie, and what makes it great? From the original Superman where we first saw a comic book hero fly, to Burton's dark and stylized Batman, to the graphic novel style Sin City, live action ensemble X-MEN, Spider-Man, Iron-Man, The Dark Knight, the entire MCU....all of these are comic book movies, and depending on your personal definition probably range from good to great. And they're all live action with varying degrees of special effects, and some with animation. If you had to pick ones that 'feel the most like a comic book', you'd probably pick Sin City for the overall look, and the phase 3 MCU films for a combination of visuals and capturing the tone and spirit of the comic book story arcs.

But they aren't literally animated comics. The closest to that would probably be the animated movies, right? Like Mask of the Phantasm or any number of the Marvel animated movies. But again those are really 'just cartoons', and I don't mean that in a bad way. They're simply cartoon versions of comic books.

Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse is quite literally an animated comic book, and yet it is so much more at the same time. It's an explosion of comic book ink and paper, a dizzying palette of superbly rich colors, a jaw dropping display of digital artistry melded with living, breathing characters we care about, a story that is perfectly derived from the very medium in which it is being created and yet not for one single moment ever feels forced or hollow, a soundtrack fused with an endless exploration of a massive city, staggeringly sized scientific chambers, gigantic forests, and neon-electric-digital-dreamscapes of action set pieces that whir and click and come to life exactly as they do in the minds of children reading them on paper.

This movie is breathtakingly good in every aspect. Like-I'm-questioning-my-sanity-is-it-really-as-good-as-I-think-it-is!?!? Yes. Yes yes yes.

Remember the old Sega game Comix Zone? And how it was like ""oh wow! It's a comic book come to life!""? This is like that, with modern technology, cranked up a thousand times.

But here's the most important part - *it was all done in the right way, by the right people, at the right time*. It feels like this project was greenlit and handed to the very people who created comic books themselves with a ""here ya go, you have full creative control. Oh and by the way you have an unlimited budget! And resources! Have as much fun making a great movie as you possibly can!""

My first job was working in a movie theater. I took full advantage of being able to see free movies. I've built a decent surround sound system with all the creature comforts and have a growing library of movies. From the re-release of the original Star Wars trilogy, to each of the prequels and to the ongoing trilogy today, T-2, Titanic, the original X-Men, Avatar, The Dark Knight, Avengers, Avengers: Infinity War and so many more...I've gone to many, many big movie theater events for the experience. And I can safely say hands down that Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse in 3D is the best moviegoing experience I have ever had. It's that great.",10

Well this is one of those. This is a almost rather perfect film. Let me just say the the stylished animation is just top notch. It as if the comic book leaped off the pages. I've seen practically all super hero films to include the DC animated ones. This feels as if they took comic books and Playstation animation and just came up with this perfect look.

And the story is great.. the pacing is so wonderful. It is able to tell the story.. and an origin without boring us to tears like Zack Snyder has done in the DC universe. The story is quiet touching. And it allows us to have a pretty interesting Spider Man in Miles WITHOUT thrashing or having a Peter Parker like experience.

Plus our the villains are so well done..

But I think we will see a lot more of this type of animation in the future from Sony. I think they announced their presence with authority.. like how Dreamworks did with Shrek.. and how Pixar did.

I'll make a separate one for the film laterm I just feel like he deserves his own review. That's how great Peter is in this film.

Into The Spider-verse reminds us why we love Spiderman so much, and does so in an original and humane way.

I used to love Spiderman as a kid. I got obssessed with the cartoons he starred in as well as the original movie trilogy, one that actually helped me get interested in the character and marvel as a whole. But my love for this character, as most things, dissolved and it never got around to build itself up again, even after constant remakes and wonderful performances. I never felt that spark again, that love I felt for this charming dude was gone, dead.

Then Into The Spider-verse came, and my whole world turned upside down. I felt a fire inside my stomach. There it was, that long-forgotten love for Peter Parker, one that I thought I would never experience again, expanding continuously as the movie progressed, hitting me in all the right places.

I'd even dare to say that this movie made me understand the reason as to why spider-man is universally loved:

He's an everyday guy with super powers, that's it. He's flawed but pure at heart. He's relatable. He belongs to the people. He's one of us.

This movie's fresh take on Peter Parker is exactly what we needed to fully grasp that, how compelling this character can be without using any of his super powers. This version of Peter Parker is fat, subtly depressed, and tired, yet he's the most charming and lovable version of this character yet. It's something we haven't seen in quite a while, the genuine humanity that makes Peter Parker such a charismatic character, and one can only be thankful for it.

Spider-man is cool again, but in a totally different, and perhaps even better, way. Just your everyday dude taking a leap of faith, giving the audience who relates to his struggles courage to do the same. This is what Spiderman can be and what he should be. A character that's ours, a character that teaches you that anyone can be a hero, that's the real Spiderman. This is the true Homecoming. Spiderman is freaking back! Welcome home!",10

Currently, film studios are all about the ""extended universe"", seeing how many different titles and characters they can shove into one franchise (Avengers, X-Men, Justice League), making for an easy way to squeeze a few extra bucks out of their lesser known properties. Comics have this as well, of course. However, they also have something modern movies haven't really tapped into yet: story one-offs, a chance for a storyteller to create a unique tale and not be constrained by the implications on or from the larger universe. Spider-Verse gets to do just that, while playfully taking on the fun (if convoluted) absurdity of extended superhero universes. Listen, I hear you. ""How could we possibly need another Spider-Man movie?"" Spider-Verse understands that question and has a take on it. Yes, Peter Parker is here. In fact, there are two Peter Parkers. There's also a Spider-Woman, a Noir Spider-Man, an anime Spider-Girl/Robot, and a Spider-Pig. At the center though is Miles Morales, an Afro-Hispanic Brooklyn teen who must help these other Spider-People get back to their own planes of existence. He fights with his cop dad, he adores his shady uncle, hates being simply the smartest kid in the room, and just wants to do something that matters. Being Spider-Man wasn't his idea, but hey, when a radioactive spider gives you powers, what choice do you have? Look, I don't have any sort of hot take on this movie.

What if you have no choice? From the very beginning, Spider-Man: Into the Spicer-Verse is very energetic and captures your attention. This animated film has impressive visuals. The music creates a fantastic rhythm. And you just want to watch more.

The story follows a high school student named Miles Morales, who just changed school. He goes into an abandoned subway station with his uncle Erin and gets bitten by a radioactive spider. Ever since that day, Miles starts sticking to everything he touches. Then, he meets Spider-Man (Peter Parker), teams up with some friends from the same dimension and they attempt to save the world from the villain Kingoin.

The story is very original and makes the impossible possible. It takes all the abilities of Spider-Man to far and beyond with its action scenes. The film also shows a very real family atmosphere and the humor is smart. I love the non-traditional characters and how they embrace diversity. And yes! Spider-Man is Latino and surely does speak Spanish! There are also some fun new characters.

With this film, Marvel has created a film that celebrates comics, film and visual arts. Of course, it celebrates Spider-Man and makes this super hero relevant and contemporary. It is absolutely eye-poppingly beautiful and really pushes the boundaries of the genre with its colors, textures and camera movements. There are several different forms of animation in one film. You feel as if you are actually reading a comic book or the comic book is coming to life.

Naturally, the film does a very touching tribute to genius Stan Lee. I feel the filmmakers took some risks bringing new ideas to this iconic character which as been adored for over 50 years. The result is a must-see family movie that is even more appealing to new generations. I also love how this film is animated. It's so different. I've never seen a film like this one. I think it's very unique. Be sure to stay after the credits to see something very special, including another set of credits at the very end.

This film sets a new era in animated movies. I recommend it for ages 5 to 18, as well as adults. I give it 5 out of 5 stars and include it in my Oscar predictions as a very possible winner. This is the film parents will love their kids to watch and kids will enjoy in many different ways.

With great power comes great responsibility and we all can be heroes. This is the idea behind Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse - inclusion for all in the vast universe and the idea that we can all be heroes by making the right choices and doing our best helping each other in our everyday life.

It met all of my expectations, and then went above and beyond them. The animation is a blend of CGI, stop animation, pop/comic book art and realism. The vibrant colors pop out at you, and the action sequences really enthrall. A very captivating and beautiful piece of art is this movie, and the writing choices leave nothing to be desired. The story is that of the traditional starting superhero with a bunch of twists thrown in. The movie itself actually follows past comics for the most part, with some minor changes here and there. A true Spider-Man, or comic book fan in general, will not have anything to criticize in this movie. Everything that fans want to see out of Spidey(s) is in this movie. There are multiple different variations of Spider-Man in the film, and all of them have their special moments to shine. The end credit scene just rockets this movie up past my already positive expectations, and it gets a 10/10 from me! The movie can be enjoyed by both young and old alike, and trust me, it will blow your mind! Best animated film of 2018, and one of the best superhero movies ever made.

However, this could alone stand out to be a much better spiderman film in comparison to them all. Into the spiderverse takes you on a sci-fi adventure of multiverse, a spiderman film we have all been waiting for.

The animation alone stands out to be the best feature about this film. This new style of comic book animation is top notch and a must watch especially for comic book lovers. The efforts taken in creating and rendering this film was worth it. The film is innundated with so much of high quality design, byzantine animation, one can't take their eyes off the screen and even afford to miss a scene.

Even though it has a small run time to it, as most animated films do, this film offers a good character development and good storyline which is unpredictable at times making you shout out ""wow"" especially if you are a spiderman geek.

There is an adequate amount of humor. The humor is not forced at all, it has good one liners that makes you enjoy the film from the very beginning.

The trailer displayed the artwork pretty well, but still I didn't want to get my hopes up. The reviews made it sound like the best Spiderman movie ever. So I went to the movie theater and watched it with my brother. And I was, in short absolutely captivated.

Miles Morales is a teen protege growing up in Brooklyn with a hard nosed cop for a dad, a loving mother and an uncle, Aaron who helps him explore his ambition as a graffiti artist. The problem is the new school he goes to isn't the life he's looking for, and he is doing all he can to get out of it, against his family's wishes.But that all changes when he meets three people: a girl in his class named Gwen Stacy, a 26 year old blonde guy named Peter Parker and a radioactive spider.

Because of a portal opened by Wilson Fisk, the dna of. Spider-Man attracts in alternate Spider-Ma.... i mean Spider-People, dragging them all into Miles' Brooklyn neighborhood. It's up to them, including a middle aged and cynical Peter, Spider-Woman, Spider- pig, and a depressed and grungy Spider-Man Noir, to stop Kingpin from using the portal again to rip a hole in the space time continuum.

But that being said, that doesn't touch a bit on how hilarious, how heart breaking, and how endearing the scenes can be moment by moment. The animation and concept art go hand in hand, and gives the film a high tech, pop art appeal like nothing the world has ever seen at this scale or skill. Words can't describe the way this movie moves and feels like the best comic book ever written.

I can't recommend this enough. Go watch this movie right now and you will not be disappointed But don't watch it if you have epilepsy or anything like that. It gets pretty flashy.",10

The animation is stunning, the soundtrack is amazing and the dialogue and storyline is so heart-warming. The characters are memorable, they all bring their own emotions rubbing off on the audience, and the humor is right on, its daring and hilarious and doesn't seem forced like you might see in some of the MCU films. There's been 7 Spider-Man films in the last 16 years and this might be the best one yet, its pays its respect to the past films while driven on its own storyline adventure, being such a known character the movies still comes out as original. The cinematography and animation are gorgeous, definitely oscar worthy. I'd say this is one of the best superhero origins movies ever made. Then there's the numerous amount of easter eggs, be on the lookout for those. I can't say the movies underrated cause its be treated just as it should be, but if there's one thing that its underrated its the soundtrack, the funny thing is the soundtrack is the exact type of music Miles Morales would listen to, so I guess you could say there's a touch of realism. In the end all I can see is go see this movie for yourselves, the visual experience is amazing, its touching and serious, funny and witty, brings more emotion than some of the superhero movies you'll see today and best of all if your sick of superhero movies this is a complete different and fresh start of the genre.

Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is a mind-blowing film.

I love the fact that this movie, makes us feel nostalgic about the previous big screen adaptations of Spider-Man. The animation is awe-inspiring. The comic book format of the animation is unique & is perfect for one of the most loved comic book characters. The 3D is amazing(watch this film on the biggest screen possible, preferably IMAX). The action set pieces, the humour & the emotional scenes are perfectly balanced, throughout. The voice-over work is unforgettable. Shameik Moore is spectacular as Miles Morales. Moore brings that much needed vulnerability to his character. Jake Johnson is outstanding as Peter B. Parker. Hailee Steinfeld is brilliant as Gwen Stacy. Mahershala Ali is perfect as Uncle Aaron. Brian Tyree Henry is excellent as Jefferson Davis. John Mulaney, Kimiko Glenn & Nicolas Cage are awesome as Spider-Ham, Peni Parker & Spider-Man Noir, respectively.

Not only is it already my favorite best comic book movie but it may even be one of the best animated films I've ever seen, rivaling Pixar's best. The animation pops and brings comic book pages to life right down to the 'Kirby Krackle'. Animators have attempted this unique blend of 2D and 3D animation styles that just work wonders in translating the comic book feel to motion unlike anything before. A very visionary alternative to the 3D Pixar style that has become the industry standard since Toy Story back in 1995. It's even psychedelic in parts. They've done some clever use of dialogue boxes, thought bubbles and transitions that are unique to comic books. Every single frame is brimming with Spiderman references ranging from iconic to those obscure deep comic book lore. The screenplay is crisp and sharp too. I'd totally be okay if the current live action superhero boom ends with Avengers 4 next year (just because I'm already committed) and shifts to this format going forward. #IntotheSpiderverse is an innovative, kinetic and endearing masterpiece.

Added to this: I am a huge fan of Miles Morales. Now hearing this you may assume that I'd love anything with Spider-Man... and... I mean... you're not wrong. I don't think I outright 'hate' anything Spider-Man related. But at the same time, no other Spider-Man movie has had me writing reviews on Amazon, Fandango, IMDB, and Rotten Tomatoes singing its praises.

Into the Spider-Verse is (to me)- without a doubt- the best Spider-Man movie yet. And to be fair, if there was ever a movie I was skeptical about, it was this one. Sony Animation-- the same people who did The Emoji Movie and the Smurfs films-- making the first Marvel animated movie (not counting Big Hero 6)?? Was't looking too good... But DANG did they knock it out of the park! Not only are the visuals outstanding-- using 3D animation in an almost unprecedented way where it seriously looks like it is a living comic book-- but the cast, soundtrack, and story are all phenomenal. For anyone who reads the comics, there's plenty of Spider-Man fan service. For anyone who doesn't, there's plenty here to keep you thoroughly entertained throughout. It's got its moments of being down-to-earth, it's got humor, it's got heart. It's definitely a super hero film, but it's also a coming-of-age film.

If you even remotely enjoy Spider-Man, do yourself a favor and check this out!",10

Sony's last few attempts with the character of Spider-Man have been underwhelming to say the least. I haven't seen a good Sony owned Spider-Man movie since 2004's Spider-Man 2. Luckily, Spider-Man: Homecoming turned out to be a pretty good film, but that was mainly Disney and Marvel Studios, so I still had low expectations. However, I am happy to say that Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is an awesome Spider-Man film, and an amazing film overall. Instead of following Peter Parker like every other Spider-Man film out there, this film instead tells the story of Miles Morales and how he handles being Spider-Man. This is a bit different, however, because instead of skipping the learning and the suit making, we see his struggles firsthand. Miles makes a promise to his world's original Spider-Man that he would put a stop to Kingpin, but he has no idea how to control his powers, so he has a hard time. Luckily, Kingpin's fancy collider machine happens to bring in some other Spider-Man, as well, so that Miles can get the help that he needs. The best part about this film is the way the characters are handled. The writers understand the character of Spider-Man, no matter what dimension he/she is from. They all have different personalities and art styles that make them stand out from each other. They did such a great job that I now want to see spin-off films for all of the Spider-Men in this movie. Into the Spider-Verse is a lighthearted film, and is able to mix seriousness with comedy for the perfect effect. From the comedy aspect, the film, as I said before, understands Spider-Man. He is a funny character and knows how to stay calm in any situation. He cracks goofy jokes and says witty one-liners. With this movie, the different personalities of the different Spider-Men mixing together brings the comedy. On the other hand, the serious family issues bring some conflict to different characters, but in order to keep this spoiler free, I will not go in depth. There is one issue I have with the film, but it isn't too big. Okay, the character is too big, but the issue is not. Kingpin, I feel, needed more characterization in order for me to think of him as a good villain. We learned some things about his family, but that was really it. He was a just a large man who wanted to conduct an evil plot. I can look past this, however, because the movie wasn't really focused on Kingpin. It was more focused on the Spider-Men, and most importantly, Miles Morales. Since this was done so well, I can forgive the film the Kingpin issue. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse was a film that was much needed on Sony's part, because it shows that they still have good things they can do with the character. Animation, I feel, is the best format for Spider-Man, but that might be because I grew up watching the Spider-Man animated series. Overall, this is an awesome film, and definitely deserves a watch. If you are a Spider-Man fan, I believe you will truly adore this movie as much as I did. If you are a heavy critic who doesn't know much about the character of Spider-Man, I think you will enjoy this movie too. If you just like movies in general, go out and see this movie. It's worth it.",10

Boy was I wrong. This probably my favorite spider man movie. It as great characters, great comic book action, great emotional moments, great animation. I also liked in some particular scenes they were down for using violence. In the movie a character gets crushed and another one gets shot. Although it didn't actually show any blood or anything, it's still a bit over the top for a PG movie. But I'm glad they had the balls to do that. It also feels like your watching an actual comic book. Like they have those sound effects like when spider man thwips his webs and when characters punch and kick each other and explosions go off. It feels like a panel of a comic come to life. I also like how they make peter and Gwen's backstories hilariously sad. This is actually a pretty funny movie. I was suprised that this movie was funny. I also like they have journeys for the two main characters that are wrapped up by the end of the film. This film also shows how the character of spider man is so inspirational and important. How he matters not just to the marvel universe but how he relates to people who read his stories. And the post credits scene is probably my favorite of this year. Wait till the end to see it. I pretty much loved everything about this movie except probably Kingpin. He was underdeveloped a lot and I wish he was given more to do. Overall though, Spider man into the spider verse is a blast of a film and I am going to give it a 9.7/10",10

However, when I sat down and watched this in theaters, I'd have to say that it's the best movie I've in 2018. For those who haven't see this film, I won't spoil any of the plot points. Getting that out of the way I loved many styles the film portrayed. The films way of creating a layered animation, in which, you can see multiple different versions of the same person or object. It mostly gave off the feel of looking through the eyes of a spider.

I was also happy to see in this film that they didn't keep dragging on the same story, but just using different actors or scenes. No film, like Spider-Man Homecoming, gave a new outlook on Spider-Man. With a diverse cast whom all seemed to voice act perfectly, my favorite being John Mulaney, they didn't just feel like a bland group of individuals. Instead, the film allowed for the audience to really connect with each character. I don't think that the animation ruins it, I also don't think that it would have changed the quality of the film if it wasn't animated.

So, what can a really say? Well, I came into the movie theaters expecting another super-hero movie, but instead, I got to watch a miraculous film that makes me want to become a super-hero fan. It was perfect and amazing.",10

Okay, from the beginning: this movie is excellent. It is a thrill ride from start to finish, from being inventive to charting a new story to introducing so many good characters. Miles Morales' story is unique, emotional, and above all, fun.

Performances: they're voice performances, so at first glance there isn't much to consider, but once you get further into the movie, you hear these actors truly commit to their characters. Shameik Moore's voice embodies Miles Morales perfectly, and Jake Johnson finally finds a character that's not a stoner; he does have fun with it. Haliee Steinfeld is exhilarating and perfect as Spider-Gwen. The rest of the cast... they're all fantastic, I just don't have time to talk about it right now. Go Spider-Ham!

Direction/Writing: with three different directors, you'd expect this to come off as jumbled and incoherent, but it is not that at all. The scenes are well executed, the fight choreography is exhilarating, and the way they blend animation is simply stunning. The writing was soooooooo goooooooood. Phil Lord really had a story he wanted to tell, and he didn't skip out on any opportunity; somehow, we'll be laughing one minute and bawling the next. He really left it all on the field, especially with all ridiculous avenues he decided to go down with characters like Spider-Ham, Penny Parker, and Spider-Man Noire. The best part is it all works! The villain, Kingpin, is a bit sidelined, but it doesn't matter in the end because the story is about Miles and the people in his life. There's a moment in the trailer where Miles jumps off a building and we get this beautiful upside-down shot, and that moment is somehow even more satisfying given everything that leads up to it. The combo of story and characters truly does work.

There's so many things I could talk about, from the immersive world to the killer soundtrack to the fact they use sound effects that correspond to the character's respective universes. You can feel the amount of time and effort that went into this movie, and you can feel that feeling of satisfaction that it paid off. It's a truly unique movie and inventive experience that is a sight to behold. (10/10)

Then happily I did watch it and my review is just short: This movie is a fascinating graphic that please your eyes! Take a very big applause for artistic department and all team that make the idea of parallel universe could be combined with the original story of Spiderman. The identity, friendship, battles, family relations of Peter Parker became clear enough for the whole story of Spiderman series itself. How we ever knew about him, what is going on in his world, and when Spiderman transform himself to be a hero, is explained more here, and with the special appearances of Kingpin and his villain team, the director could lead the plots into the fun way for everybody. This is not just ordinary cartoon, but the highly qualified design graphic with the exact scenes, special effects, and bubble conversation like a moving comic-book. Every details in this animation is clearly edited by professional film-makers with any mistakes, nor any flaws. Even for Spiderman fans, this movie is so fresh to be watched and stays in his original starting point. No matter how many Spiderman movies could ever be made, this Spiderverse perhaps the first sci-fi animation I've ever watched and what a fascinating graphic to win Golden Globe very soon. And yes, I listen carefully of what Spider Gwen said because it is dubbed by my idol, Hailee Steinfeld, who will win many awards ahead.

I can safely say that Sony Pictures Animation has made the best Spider-Man movie to date, and best movie of the year. The story is your typical story, near the end it does get a little too bunched but I am more than willing to forgive it for that. The characters are excellent, I am no fan of anime at all but I loved the unique anime style and expressions Peni Parker gave, I loved the cartoonish nature of Spider-Ham, Related to the edgy nature of Spider-Man noir, Felt sympathy for Miles, emjoyed Peter Parker, and loved Gwen. The action is great, no more needs to be said. And to wrap this review up: The animation is AMAZING, never before have I seen such creative style in animation, this is the best animation I've seen ever. It follows the style of a comic book and does it perfectly.

Overall go see this movie asap. 9.8/10 (rounded up to 10/10 in the actual star rating)",10

But of course, what I loved the most was the amazing animation. Unique, accurate, and every different spider man has its own art style! Penny has a more manga art style, Spider Ham has a very cartoony style, and Noire has the 40 and 50's crime show vibe. And it nailed ALL OF THEM!

The plot took some turns I really wasn't expecting, and tons of tiny details put into the movie made me pleasantly surprised. For example, how real those moments in school felt before Miles was spider man. All that talk about puberty had me dying.

First and most importantly, it was the most visually impressive film I have seen to this day. The animation style alone had such a mystical and wonderous quality to it. The animators didn't stop there, however. They added so many little fun details that made me feel like I was watching some sort of blend between comic and movie. In addition to the gorgeous visual nature of Spider-Man, I was impressed by both the humor and the meta references. The reference to the cringey Spider-Man 3 scene and the post-credits meme reference were my personal favorites. There were tons of little details that I am sure I never truly appreciated because I have never been a consumer of comic books, but I have to imagine that this film is even more special to Marvel comic fans. The only gripe that I have with Spider-Man is that it failed to keep my attention in act 3. It was longer than it should have been, and it would have benefited greatly by cutting down 10 minutes. With that being said, this is the best movie I have seen in a few months and I hope that my review reaches someone who was not going to see it and urges them to reconsider.",9

We wondered how the story would go on, how our heroes would turn back, what would be the end of Thanos. Many theories related to this have been put forward. Avengers Endgame was undoubtedly the most anticipated film of recent years. Normally, the higher the expectation, the higher the probability of disappointment. But this is not the case for Endgame. Whatever you're expecting, you find much more in the film. This means that the biggest concern about the film has disappeared.

On the other hand, another comparison comes up. Is Endgame more successful than Infinity War? We can comfortably say it Avengers Infinity War is just the beginning of the story. Endgame was the finale of the story. So we shouldn't think of these two films as two separate stories. There is only one story divided into two parts.

Avengers Endgame is, above all, a great homage to the ten-year history of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story highlights the original Avengers team. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye are at the center of events. No character comes in front of them. Of course there are many characters that play an important role in the story outside the original Avengers team. Everyone's concern was that Captain Marvel, who was included in the Marvel world, overshadowed other heroes. We can say that this certainly did not happen. What is important in this struggle is not how strong you are, but how good you are. This comes to the fore in all areas. It gives good message about being a hero and a family.

Of course, Avengers Endgame has some critical aspects. For example, is the three-hour period necessary in terms of the story? It can be discussed. The head of the story moves much slower than the rest. It also drags the heroes into an emotional predicament. Then the tempo is rising and the heavy scenes we are watching are getting more meaningful. The last 45 minutes of the movie is fully action packed. But the last 45 minutes goes so fast that you don't even realize it. Action and battle scenes are really successful. There is not even a slight distress about visual effects. There are also slight logic errors in the film, but in general the story is so successful that these details become meaningless and insignificant after a certain point.

Lastly, Avengers Endgame doesn't have a movie end scene. Because after the film's final, there is no need for another scene. The Marvel legend Stan Lee appears with a small stage. But this is the last surprise scene in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Moreover, there is no clue about Marvel's future. This makes us wonder more about Spider-Man: Far from Home. 10/10",10

Which is why I'm not going to say anything about the movie. Not even my opinion. All I'm going to say is:

The crowd applauded 3 times during the movie, and stood up to clap their hands after. This I have never witnessed in a Dutch cinema. Dutch crowds aren't usually passionate about this. I checked the row where I was sitting, and people were crying. After the movie, I was seeing people with smudged mascara. That's all I have to say about the movie.",10

There are some very good moments in Endgame and that's coming from a long standing MCU fan growing up with these movies. In creating an extensive and emotional journey for a lot of the MCU characters, it absolutely succeeds.

Endgame ultimately is an excellent conclusion to over 10 years of film but I feel the plot's pacing and direction is really lacking to Infinity War, which 'trimmed the fat' and was much more focused and energetic. Granted, Endgame takes risks but this might be a disappointment to some fans with its slower pace that focuses on character development over action and intense sequences. The run time probably should be shorter or streamlined. Less cuts and motion blur during fight scenes would've made it easier to track fights as well.

Respect for the Russo Brothers for taking the direction they did with Endgame and it really does satisfy but Infinity War is overall a more entertaining movie. It's not the best MCU movie but I can't dispute its great conclusion.",8

Storyline: Very weak. It could have been refined. Many of the characters were inserted and wasted.

Length: It was unnecessarily prolonged, esp towards the end. They could have reduced the runtime by 20-30 minutes.

Don't want to say too much, but shine a light on Robert Downey Jr. who got to perfect his Iron Man persona to the point where Hugh Jackman can't even surpass him.

In fact, there were only a couple of absolute cringe moments and each dealt with Brie Larson, particularly her appearance in the final fight.

Thankfully though, Marvel showed a lot of restraint with that and as a result the movie really belonged to the characters that we all have invested over a decade of love and loyalty in....and honestly that was a relief. There were times where the film looked like it wanted to go the other way, and put the OG Avengers in the backseat. So, credit for not doing that.

It feels a lot more like Kill Bill 2 in atmosphere than a real Super-Hero movie, all the really fun big fights were reserved for the first film and what's left is a long closing act that is more concerned with tying up loose ends than delivering on over-the-top action. And it works for a send off film after a decade of investment.

So what you have feels very much like an intimate and sentimental film made by old friends at send off...or a funeral...but in either case it is absolutely appropriate.

Unfortunately, you have the enormously epic CGI battle at the end and I, for one, am kind of done with that trope. It's starting to bore me now, and, honestly, I would prefer something a little more authentic. But, that being said, the film at least called for it.

We've seen battles like that before, Black Panther, Aquaman, Infinity War, Lord of the Rings, and, honestly those CGI armies lack any real intimacy. So the end is kind of a bore compared to the rest of the film.

The highlight in the film would be Thor with Hulk coming in as a close second. They steal the show from the moment they are introduced and the trademark MCU humor that Black Panther and Captain Marvel utterly lacked. And the humor was a source of comfort after two films that made vague threats of taking themselves far too seriously for a superhero flick.

The wrap-up was more than satisfying if not heart-wrenching at moments making it a great send off for a decade of time and money invested in the characters, however the legacy that the MCU is passing on seems in trouble nonetheless and we can only hope that it doesn't go the route that the MCU has been teasing and toying with and continues to deliver fun superhero movies and not the heavy-handed or deadly serious films they have threatened the audience with.",10

Avengers: Endgame is a magnificent awesome superhero film that concludes the infinity stones storyline that has been building up with 22 movies in the Marvel universe. They had done a great job building up each solo character and have there films bring something new and exciting. Endgame is the game changer that delivers the ultimate climax of the story arc with the big bad Thanos (Josh Brolin) going up against the Avengers. After the previous film Infinity War leaving the audience hanging with the cliffhanger. Marvel has done a great job in marketing and keeping this film spoilers free with the trailers that only show the same footage and very minimum. Which I will say it is best to see the film knowing very little about what is going to happen.

I will try to keep this review spoiler free. Endgame is amazing and spectacular. Joe and Anthony Russo direction was fantastic and they did a great job in delivering a spectacular climax of the MCU. The plot was amazing. For a three hour long film. The film does move pretty fast and kind of feels short when watching it. I did feel like Endgame is a little short on the action set pieces like the previous films. Which this film does focus more on the emotional connections with the original Avengers like Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner) and how they were all affected by the aftermath of Infinity War. The film does have a lot of fun and feels like a wild adventure with what these characters go through. The final hour delivers all out with an epic climax which every character has a moment to shine. And makes up for the lack of action in the movie. I love how every hero works with another when fighting there enemy. There were some moments where you will be in an awe and clapping moment with the climatic battle sequence. The visual effects are top notch great. There is some fun humor that will lighten the mood of the film. And there are some tear jerking moments that will leave you feeling happy and sad at the same time. The directors did a wonderful job in surprising the audience with something new and reaching every characters full potential. The climatic fight scene with Thor, Cap America, and Iron Man teaming up and bouncing around with there super powers are just awesome. The surprises do keep on coming throughout. Which will leave you feeling satisfied.

Overall, Avengers: Endgame is a great and awesome superhero film. It is one of the best finales that Joe and Anthony Russo have delivered. The plot was amazing and fast moving. The direction focuses more on the emotional side of the characters and story. While delivering an epic climatic showdown that will have you grasping and excited. The cast ensemble was great. I will say this is one fun wild ride that I am happy how it ties the story arc together.",10

Special shoutout to Alan Silvestri for his electrifying and goosebump-inducing music, I almost had a cardiac arrest with his music. This movie is the best of the best movies, the very best. Thank you, Marvel. Thank you, the Russo brothers, Thank you Stan Lee, and Thank you, Robert Downey Jr. for entertaining us for these 11 years. We and the universe will surely miss Tony and Steve. We love you 3,000, Marvel! Thanks!",10

The recent local box record was US$20,585,253. In fact, its franchise film box office records exceeded the box office giant Avator (2009) due to top 2 films ranked on the list.

''After half of all life in the universe was killed due to the actions of Thanos in Avengers: Infinity War, the remaining Avengers and their allies must reassemble to revert those actions in one last stand.''

In fictional story tales, the good always win over the evil. And the justice side is the winner. However this Marvel franchise untraditionally broke the general principle of narrative stories successfully in 2018 with Avengers: Infinity War (2018). That was a surprise when we saw Thanos turns Marvel heroes into dust in the infinity war.

Hitchcock said that the stronger the antagonist is, the more engaging the audience in the film.

He believed that his antagonists should be attractive and complex in order to awaken curiosity. The more flaws and insecurities a villain has, more the spectator will recognize his humanity and, as humans themselves, be aware of how malevolent he can be. This will incite vulnerability in the viewer, who usually has ambiguous impressions of these villains.

However Thanos is too strong like multi corporation billionaires, C.E.O.s who earn 312 times more money of average workers.

CEOs for the 350 largest US companies earned an average pay of $18.9 million in 2017, a sharp 17 percent increase from the previous year, according to a new study by the left leaning Economic Policy Institute. These estimates include salaries, bonuses, restricted stock grants, cashed-in company stock, and other forms of compensation for chief executives at those firms. Meanwhile, wages for the average US worker grew a paltry 0.2 percent during that time.

The growing power gap among Thanos and Marvel heroes are cinematic equivalence of growing gap of inequality among CEOs and average workers. This is why we feel some kind of reality and apocalyptic atmosphere in this film. Supremacy of individual power is at the maximum level in this film.

Thanos is the representative of all antagonists. We can say that the true protagonist is the antagonist who is more powerful than the protagonist. Thus, the antagonist becomes the protagonist in this film. It is dialectically new and meaningful.

Thanos is the ultimate antagonist in film history.",1

Unfortunately, like most huge corporations the focus of the Marvel-machine was more to please the mass of escapists than their true fans by utilising a psychological formula which on one hand shows superpowers, but at the same time makes fun of the heroes in order not to loose rationalistic ""non-believers"", plus they spiced it up with sexy heroes.

Nothing wrong with that, if it would have not been done at the expense of good credible stories or an awe for the heroes - instead now any teen who really admires a superhero will be injected with a pinch of nihilism - enough not to take it all serious anymore in the long run. In other words: by distancing themselves from their heroes in the long run Marvel destroys its own world.

Compare that to DCs Wonder Woman: Whilst this movie also had really funny moments it drew me so deep into her credible world that I got so emotionally evolved that payed to watch it eight times in the cinema. Infinity War and Endgames in opposition to WW I am not inspired to watch again.

Knowing that Stan Lee did die in this year and this was going to be his last cameo, even though I didn't like Infinity war, I felt like that this movie would give me the closure not only for the cut of storyline but also for Stan Lee. It did and despite the huge amount of visual effects I found it really easy to let the Marvel Universe go, knowing that there is no valuable content or inspiration in it for me anymore.

Were do I start. At the start, or should I say for the first 30 min all the characters are depressed and feeling sorry for themselves. Then they mention time travel, yes time travel. I mean after all Marvels great films and ideas the best they could come up with to get things back to normal was time travel. What next, Ironman (Robert Downey Jr) wakes up back in Ironman 1 and the last 20 years have all been a dream aka Dallas style. Come on give me a break the best they could come up with was time travel. Anyway 1 1/2 hours into the film I turned to my friend and said the last 1 1/2 hours must be amazing as this has been so boring and all the reviews say this is a great movie.

But after I did the Double Feature (at the Midnight premiere) with Infinity War almost 2 weeks ago, I re-watched Endgame yesterday and it was as amazing as my first impression of it was! And while I will not spoil anything about Endgame, I will talk about things Infinity War! So if you have not seen that yet, do not blame me for anything revealed here.

My summary is a pop culture reference and there are quite a few in the Marvel movies, hinting at other franchises (Alien got name checked for example in Infinity War and even ""copied"" or ""homaged"" if you will and there are a few in Endgame too). But those little digs are not too important, they are just nice touches for those who know them. Having an understanding of the MCU as a whole, from Phase 1 to now Phase 3 is way more important. And as someone who is not too familiar with the comics myself, I can tell you that knowing the movies is enough to enjoy the franchise.

Still you can google the other stuff or even make your own conclusions. Now that is a lot of foreword and I haven't even gotten one word about Endgame. But as I said above, no spoilers here. What we do know (from the trailers) is the beginning. But whatever we saw and thought we knew - what happens not even half an hour into the movie, will rattle you. Now what?

Yes the first hour of the movie is ""slow"", but it had to be. There are ramifications after the snap and the characters we learned to love, that we have close to our heart, have been torn apart. Quite literally gone with the wind - everyone is thinking how is this going to be resolved (no pun intended)? And the movie will give you answers, and will even try to sort of explain things that are quite - unexplainable.

And while there is full on drama, there is still a lot of humor. The movie takes beloved characters and does things to them - or rather the weight of what happened does things to them. What exactly? Well that would be telling, but let me tell you some very bold choices have been made. And if you are not emotional at least during some scenes, you are taking away a lot of fun for yourself.

I can be a cynic too at times, but taking this apart (which you can do with every movie), is only hurting your own viewing pleasure. There is so much love in this, for the characters, for details, for the fans - it's just a rollercoaster and I'm not afraid to say that I shed a couple of tears. It is after all tying knots and bringing certain things to a conclusion.

That doesn't mean there isn't anything more coming (because we know there is, next up Spiderman as an in between movie before Infinity War?). And there are some familiar faces coming back to Endgame from other movies that we haven't seen in a while but also new cameos like Ken Jeong. I'm guessing there will be a deleted scene with him, his scene seems to short for storytelling purposes I reckon.

Epic fights, epic emotions and dialog that is hinting at things to come later in the movie ... which you will see even clearer with repeat viewing(s) ... The Russos did it - Kudos to them, Kevin Feige, Stan Lee (RIP) and everyone else involved in this of course

Edit: Endgame works even for people who have not seen a single MCU movie yet (confirmed by a friend of mine). But of course the gravitas and the conclusions of everything will work way better if you have seen the rest of the movies. Also let me add that this is ""technically sound"" as some would put it - or just plain great visually speaking. But I reckon this is a given anyway. Popcorn (or Nachos or whatever you prefer) to perfection",10

Having enjoyed Infinity War but thought it could have been better all around, the overall hype for Endgame had its match made. Now having watching this film in theaters as it was a must watch to (due to the 3D experience and also knowing the longer one waited, the more likely spoilers would have been exposed, ruining the experience and essence of the film).

As a film, won't say much but this film delivers on expectations. Had no knowledge of the overall plot but within the first few minutes, one was excited and was there for the thrill of the ride throughout. With a runtime of over three hours (including end credits), the film has a great pace and doesn't feel nearly as long (which is great since something is always happening). Due to its great cast and plethora of characters, there really is never a dull moments and the film is ensured and filled with moments of surprise, suspense, action emotion and overall greatness.

Now the overall plot of time travel was well done and brought back many memories to the other Avenger films. The wait for the film was most definitely worth it, and this film will most doubly become one of the biggest movies of alltime. Will need to see this film probably once more in theaters before its run is over and most definitely will see it again multiple times afterwards to soak in its greatness. Avengers: Endgame is more than a movie, it's a moment - a moment in time. Cherish every moment.",10

It did have some nice ""moments"", especially the anticipated big fight towards the end. Some characters get a good inning - love Antman and, of course, Iron Man but this is my least favourite MCU film.

Not that there aren't going to be anymore movies. Disney likes making money. But with several main actors' contracts being up and bowing out, this will be the end for several of the original Avengers team. What results is something we've never quite see in a film: a season finale, the culmination of a franchise of multiple movies, characters, and story arcs. (The sheer logistics involved making this must've been insane.) And I had the hell of a time with it all!

The one big issue about Avengers: Infinity War, the first installment of this film two-parter, is that it had to juggle so many characters, that there wasn't a lot of time for characterization. However, now the cast is narrowed down to mostly the original Avengers. Brought back is the characterization that made so many of the previous films. Here we find the heroes at their lowest and trying to right things. What proceeds is a great character piece We see the conclusion to some of stories of people we've gotten to know after all these years. The finale is the most I've ever been emotionally influenced by a film.

Although this is an ensemble piece, Robert Downey Junior's Tony Stark/Iron Man is the big lead, the hero that started the whole universe off and all his scenes, his highs and low, are great.

Thanos is in less of this, but the cool, collected planner still makes a great villain.

Fans of the movie also get to see callbacks to so many plot points and surprise character appearances. (Although, some things might fly over your head if you can't remember or haven't had the time or inclination to watch everything.) In fact, be prepared for many surprises in general.

There is some pretty serious subject matter here, especially the first act. However the script manages to nicely balance this with humor. Both Chris Hemsworth as Thor and Paul Rudd as Ant-Man have some great delivery and lines.

The movie looks great. (Again, the ability to make Thanos' facial expressions look so realistic is amazing.) Although, I wished some scenes were lit a little brighter. You can't always make everything out. The final fight scene is amazing and may be considered one of the all time greats.

Admittedly, the movie doesn't have quite the tension of Infinity Wars. The second act is interesting, but not as strong as the beginning or end.

Considering the hype of Captain Marvel being in this, she really isn't used much. Karen Gillan does a great job as Nebula and she appears more than in any of her other films, but I kind of still wanted to see more interaction between her the and the other cast mates. A majority of characters from previous films are in this, but if you wanted to find out whatever happened to Lady Sif or Sharon Carter be prepared to be disappointed. I'm really surprised about Sharon, considering that the directors who forged her character did this movie, too.

Overall, this movie was an event that will make you feel all the feels, and I recommend you see this before it's spoiled.

P.S. Don't worry about sticking through the credits. No end final scene this time. (They really wanted to set this up as a final chapter.) Thought there is a slight something if you're a movie completionist.",10

The world is in shambles, after Thanos(Josh Brolin) succeeds with his nefarious plan. All the remaining Avengers reunite to stop Thanos, no matter what the consequences.

Avengers: Endgame is a mind-blowing film. Directors Anthony Russo & Joe Russo have given us an absolutely satisfying conclusion to the Infinity Saga, which consists of all 22 Marvel Cinematic Universe movies which have released, so far. The emotional moments make you shed a tear or two. Don't worry though. The comedic moments are aplenty, as well. The effortless chemistry & the banter among all the Avengers, remains intact. The action set pieces are glorious. The climactic set piece is the highlight of the film. You will cheer till you no longer can, as so many moments will bring you pure & unadulterated joy! The visual effects are brilliant. The 3D is eye-popping. Robert Downey Jr. is spectacular as Tony Stark/Iron Man. Chris Evans is outstanding as Steve Rogers/Captain America. Mark Ruffalo is fantastic as Bruce Banner/Hulk. Chris Hemsworth is incredible as Thor. Scarlett Johansson is unforgettable as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow. Jeremy Renner is superb as Clint Barton/Hawkeye. Don Cheadle is effective as James Rhodes/War Machine. Paul Rudd is amazing as Scott Lang/Ant-Man. Brie Larson is awesome as Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel. Karen Gillan is awe-inspiring as Nebula. Danai Gurira is impressive as Okoye. Bradley Cooper is hysterical as Rocket. Josh Brolin is flawless as Thanos. The supporting cast is scene-stealing in their respective roles. Avengers: Endgame is a must watch. Go & experience this action-packed, hilarious, emotional & wholesomely entertaining rollercoaster ride of a film. My all-time favorite Marvel Cinematic Universe movie & the best superhero film, of all time. Absolutely jaw-dropping stuff!",10

You can think of it as a TV show finale. After 21 episodes that are all feature length. And before you can even say ""oh no those are all terrible"", this immediately proves itself to be an exception to that rule. Where the equally masterful Infinity War was almost one long action climax, this is less about fights. Which doesn't mean it doesn't have any. Or that they're anything less than excellent. And this film is definitely never boring. This focuses on character exploration. Every member of the original Avengers team, and a handful individuals that aren't, all get significant depth. I remain one of the few people who argue that Age of Ultron did deliver that, albeit in small concentrated format. This easily tops that. Everyone is pushed into a situation new to them. The trailers hint at some of these, whilst leaving others as incredible surprises. Make sure you avoid spoilers before watching this.

This picture moves fast and packs a lot into its not quite lean running time. In other words, it's directed by the Russo Brothers. The length is justified. I wouldn't cut anything from this. The emotional moments don't feel sappy. The countless callbacks and references don't feel like they're just there to make you feel good for paying attention to all that lead to this one. The acting shows just how well all of these performers understand the characters. And the screenplay does the same for the writers. The effects are astonishing, yet again getting us to care about individuals that we know are all CG. It uses the varied skills, equipment and the like, of the unique heroes and villains, creatively. This delivers deeply satisfying closure. It truly is a conclusion. It's not trying to get you back to the theatre for the next adventure. The few currently confirmed entries into this franchise don't need hyping, anyway. Spider-Man with Mysterio? Another Black Panther story? The unfairly fired James Gunn returning to round out the trilogy of the Guardians of the Galaxy? Solo Black widow, *finally*? More Dr Strange? Shang-Chi, The Eternals, Blade? Keep 'em coming.

I recommend this to everyone who's taken this entire journey. And if you're someone who's skipped some, or held off on this series up to this point, this is an excellent reason to address that. Unless they're simply not to your liking. This is not going to change that. It's not meant to. 10/10",10

After thinking about ""what I was disappointed with"", I would say the following:

1. The broadway voices of Nathan lane, Ernie sambella and Jeremy irons really added that punch to the characters that you ""don't know that you're missing till it's gone"". Here I feel these characters fall flat with the ""less projecting voices"" and it was very noticeable. Seth Rogan was the best, but still, the missing ""broadway aspect"" these voices carried made the movie fall flat where it just could have been cast better???

2. So many of the little humorous exchanges with the hyenas and with rafiki were taken away. Part of the magic of the lion king was in the humor which was lost in this film. They did try and compensate a little, but I feel the laughter was just not there. Whoopi goldberg and cheech Marin were comedians, why was this not explored more to bring new comedians in for the hyenas roles?

Without the booming voices and humour, you realize that the movie is lacklustre where you are left with the story and the cinematography only. The cinematography is fantastic and I know this is a super hard movie to live up to the original, but I feel a lot of the magic that make this movie ""a whole package"" was just not there.

I wanted to love this movie. I was over the moon excited for it. They took out too many important parts of the original. Showing the strength of Mufasa but also his friendly side (his friendship with Zazu, how he respects and hugs Rafiki, that he taught Simba how to pounce). Even the opening scene wasn't the same. Why would you alter that? The huge rising sun in tune with the music that gives almost everyone goosebumps. The new one you see trees with a slightly lit up morning sky and then a small sun appears off to the side that isn't in sync with the music. Mufasas personality doesn't sound the same even though it's still James Earl Jones' voice. It's different somehow. The hyenas are not the same. They don't make jokes and laugh at themselves like ""make mine a cub sandwich"" then laugh hysterically at their own jokes. They eliminated Ed, the one who doesn't speak, just laughs. Timon isn't flamboyant or half as funny as the original. The hula scene in the original was fast paced and funny to distract the hyenas. The new one he slowly sings ""Be our Guest""?? No action and not as fun. In fact, ALL of the new characters (including Beyoncé) sound like they are just reading from a script and it's really mundane and forced. None of them are in character and flow like the original. There's no sass or wit. The music is boring. It's a huge disappointment. Rafiki catches Simbas hair and knows immediately it's him. In the original, he knows the scent, but it takes him a minute to figure it out and when he does, he's ecstatic. Not in the remake. There is no image of Mufasa in the clouds to guide Simba to remember who he is. Rafiki doesn't give him a lesson about how the past can hurt with his stick. Simba doesn't hug Rafiki like his father did which is also symbolic to how Simba is like his father. I don't understand why Disney would eliminate these bonds and characters that we all love and change it to make what is a visually stunning movie into something I will never want to see again.",1

James Earl Jones will never get a bad review in my book, he did his job. Everyone else was simply forgettable. The cartoon version I remember each actor, each song, each joke, etc and I havent watched it in years. My guess is that Disney is making all these worthless remakes to maintain the copyrights of those movies, but there's 0 intention to do it with the same magic and formula that captivated people from the beginning. The only remake I've enjoyed so far is Cinderella, we even bought it. The rest I don't even remember and my kids prefer the cartoon versions over the remakes now too, that should say something. Not that anyone at Disney will care, their goal is to take over everything to continue being in control and taking in heaps of money for their own exploits.

Most important scenes have been shortened, and useless scenes (cheaper ones my guess) have been lengthen (the mouse in the intro ? seriously ?). Yes, the goal is to put realism, but we could not tell the difference between lions (Sarabi and Nala in paritcular). Everything the original Lion King brought to us (essentially emotions, mostly from the animated faces) has been ripped off, event the few jokes by Timon and Pumbaa did not succeed to pass.

Last but not least, the music seems off too. Some good scores are here, but at the end it just seems to be put above everything like ""eyh we need to put music"" ""ok just put it anywhere you want, dont forget suggestions to the previous score for nostalgia but dont care about if it fits"".

Bad movies are one thing, ditto for a bad remake, but when it comes to a movie like this, I'm just bored. And that's the worst thing a movie could be, boring.

I was never a fan of these live-action remakes, and this is easily the worst one out of all of them, Dumbo being a close second. As bad as the remake to Beauty and The Beast was, at least it was colorful and vibrant. This was just dull, dreary, and not at all creative or interesting.

With a $250 million price tag, it achieves digitally what David Attenborough has spent his life capturing on camera. The result is jaw-droppingly photorealistic, but it also makes for a strange first impression. Imagine watching a Disneynature feature but with actors reading The Lion King screenplay over the top of it and the effect would be eerily similar. It takes time to accept lifelike looking animals talking like cartoon characters, but the ground-breaking technical skill in which they are brought to life makes the bumpy journey worthwhile.

Every tress of fur, crack in the arid soil and sun-swept vista is rendered in such immense detail that it's unsurprising that many people are calling this reboot live-action. It's a monumental technical achievement and the level of visual fidelity on display alone warrants seeing this film on the biggest screen possible.

However, in terms of the story, the film follows the original so closely that it can't help but feel second rate. Scene-by-scene, it dutifully ticks off the story beats of the 1994 original, with little by way of surprises in-between. It also doesn't help that film's photo-realism unavoidably limits the ability of the animals to convey emotion without looking unnatural or (naturally) cartoonish, and the result is a film that often creates indifference where there should be wonder. With jaw-dropping visuals, plenty of humour and solid renditions of timeless songs, it's hard to see this modern remake failing but, as it turns out, The Lion King's (2019) biggest achievement also ends up being its biggest flaw.",7

Imagine all the colour, emotion, life, magic, joy, and personality sucked out all in an instant from one of your all-time favourite movies. That's this 2019 Lion King remake in a nutshell. As the end credits were rolling, I felt nothing. I didn't care about anything. I never felt sad, happy, overjoyed, or any emotion the entire time. I was soulless, just like this entire movie was. It was Disney at their absolute worst. They took the weakest and blandest possible way out of making this movie. If you've watched the 1994 original, you've seen this movie, and anything they added or changed was pointless filler or bad changes that made the movie much, much worse than you could have ever imagined.

Why would I want to see lifeless versions of my favourite songs with the dullest visuals and animals doing nothing interesting just so this movie can stay ""Realistic""? I have no idea but someone thought it was a good idea! Was it worth it Jon Favreau? Improving your visuals so much that the goddamn animals can only open their mouths and do nothing else with their movement? Oh right, animals can't emote properly because they can't emote much in real life! Geez, I wonder why in the original Animated version these Animated characters had over-exaggerated features to be like Human beings? Oh right, so we can emotionally connect with them! It doesn't translate very well in ""Live Action""!

You can imagine alot of these shot-for-shot sequences being much worse in this ""Live-Action"" CGI remake. Scenes were dumbed down or replaced with crappy alternatives because the CGI animals couldn't do them in the movie or had no emotion to pull it off. In one of the most iconic scenes of the original movie, the audience were laughing at a very serious scene that is played to extreme dramatic effect because of how dumb it looked in ""Live-Action"". There is nothing funny going on in this scene at all. They turned one of the most emotionally devastating sequences of the original movie into a huge embarrassment. How could you do that? Why do we feel nothing for Simba and these other characters? Why do almost all the voice performances feel like they only used the first take out of so many of these talented actors? Very dull and uninspiring.

They butchered the villain Scar big time as well! In the original he was a sly, snarky, sarcastic, and quotable evil Lion with so much personality and wit behind him. In the new one he just sounds like a generic bad guy Lion who is always angry. In fact, I didn't even notice it was Scar at first! They made all the animals look so realistic you can't tell some of them apart until a character mentions them or you connect the dots with their lines taken from the original, which I have to say was very lazy as it was basically like 90% of the same dialogue. Thanks for also butchering one of my favourite characters Rafiki by the way. Even though you guys were basically doing a shot-for-shot remake, you got rid of his best moments for no reason! Timon and Pumbaa now have unfunny jokes constantly and just feel like pale imitations of their originals who were so beloved back then.

What about the filler and new stuff? Well, you get one forgettable song sung by Beyoncé in it. It doesn't fit the tone of the movie at all and just felt like Disney had to add some random song in there so they could get the Best Original Song Oscar nomination. Shenzi the Hyena is now the leader of all the Hyenas but it doesn't really go anywhere or develop her character at all. There's a new scene which shows Nala escaping the Pride Lands ruled by Scar that is just padding and adds nothing to the table at all. The Lion Sleeps Tonight gets a bit more screentime but it's just showing off bugs and animals and nothing more. There's probably more but I've already forgotten alot about this movie. They changed some of the dialogue here and there, and most of the time it's worse jokes or lines that don't feel natural at all. Even stuff like cinematography, music, and line delivery all felt off and unprofessional in large parts of the movie.

You know? The more I think about this remake, the more I get angry about it and I wish someone would just snap this piece of trash out of existence. The original was close to perfection already, so why bother remaking this movie? This is the laziest Disney cashgrab I have seen so far, and I'm getting sick of them releasing these ""Live Action"" movies being made over and over again now, but it doesn't matter because Disney is going to make loads of money anyway. This Lion King remake in particular was easily the worst one so far, because all it needed to do was rely on the brand and make the exact same movie again bring absolutely nothing new to win people over. What happened to artistic integrity, originality, or effort? I hate having to think this stupid movie exists with the original now.

Don't get me wrong, I love the original film a lot and I like Jon Faverou but both don't mix well together. Here are the few positives. Obviously the film looks visually impressive but that leads to some problems later. Most of the voice cast does a fine job. Especially Donald Glover, Billy Eichner, Seth Rogen, and John Oliver. That's where the positives end. Here are the negatives. This is essentially a shot for shot remake of the original film. There is almost nothing new except a new song which is played in the background and extended scenes of pointless scenery and a single piece of Simba's hair flying across the desert. I give some credit to the other live action remakes for at least trying to do something different, even if they didn't work but this film does almost nothing new at all. It played it safe which was the wrong direction. Some of the voice acting isn't great. James Earl Jones sounds like he wasn't even trying. It sounds like he recorded all of his lines in one take and then went home. Chiwetel Ejiofor makes Scar seem like a pathetic loser. He just fails to capture that spine tingling and energetic performance of Jeremy Irons. The songs besides Circle of Life and Can You Feel the Love Tonight just are underwhelming especially Be Prepared which for some reason was cut short. The musical score is fine but it feels like they just copy and pasted the score from the original instead of making new renditions of the score. Even if the CGI is impressive, it also serves to the film's detriment. You can't relate to the characters because the visual effects don't allow them to convey any emotion. An example would be Mufasa's death. The actor voicing young Simba does a good job conveying his grief with his voice but Simba literally has a blank stare on his face the entire time. This is a problem throughout the entire film. The animals express almost no emotions. That's the beauty of the animation style of the original. Because it was animated, the animators had free liberty to make the animals express in whatever way they wanted. Another problem would be that some of the more important moments are shorter in this film than the original. The stampede scene was about 5 minutes while in this one it feels shorter which is odd because the film is almost 30 minutes longer than the original. This all begs the question. What was the point of this film? Obviously money but there's no point to the film. It's just the same thing that is somehow almost 30 minutes longer. Overall, The Lion King is visually impressive but fails at recapturing the beauty, scope, and emotional weight of the original animated film. I give The Lion King (2019) a 1/10.",1

When Beyonce (waste of money) says ""Lions attack"" I laughed out loud. Back to Beyonce (and she wasn't alone)- in terms of voice characterisation, the characterisation part of it seems to have gone missing. These guys should have listened to any Pixar film to find out what's involved in bringing a character to life. Where was Scar's villainy? Where was the hyenas' menace? In the original cartoon Poombah and Timon were what made me squirm most but here we could have done with a bit more of them.

In fact, I don't want to be one of those people that just trashes Disney remakes based on principle. There is potential for a remake that expands and improves the emotional depth of the original. The Lion King (2019) is a far cry from this philosophy and opts for the exact opposite. The film rushes through each emotional beat of the original and fails to understand how facial expressions and dialogue can be used to sell a scene. Take Scar, for instance, everything he says feels misplaced and voidless. He doesn't feel intimidating and is honest to god a slap in the face to the original. A lot of the voice acting feels very underwhelming and could've used some refining. Others have mentioned it but realism doesn't make for a good movie.

People want to see movies where they can attach their own emotions onto it. This film completely disregards this and ultimately doesn't understand how to make a competent film. If I want to see real animals I'd watch Animal Planet. I'm in the minority on this but I think the CGI on the animals looks awful. The animation aesthetic looks dated to me and is completely devoid of colour or vibrancy. Not to mention some unintentionally goofy scenes. The jokes in this film that worked in the original, completely fail here. This due to no comedic timing and lack of body language. The new ones they've included don't appeal to me and feel like a lesser version of the jokes in the original (The fart jokes ooft). I just want to make it clear that I don't think the original is a flawless masterpiece. The second half of the original feels rushed and misses the emotional strength of the first half.

However, this one makes this issue even more obvious. This new remake stretches the pacing too its very limits. At times I felt like I was watching a 5-hour movie and I was just waiting for the sweet release of the end credits. The music was handled okay but none of the instrumentals, production and vocal performances captured the urgency and expansiveness of the original soundtrack. There is also some ill-fitted terrible Beyonce remix during the film that almost made me block my ears at how bad it was. The last thing I want to mention is the lack of originality. They didn't try to create a unique vision instead they opted for a safe version. If you have seen the original there is no reason to see this. Apart from additional jokes, alternative lines and unnecessary exposition, it felt like a more stale carbon copy of the original.

So yeah, everything I dreaded it would be. Disney has hit rock bottom and for a company that has brought so much happiness into people lives, it feels downright manipulative.",2

Firstly the way the animals were presented, their faces conveyed no emotion. This was particularly an issue when they were talking. It looked fake. Why they messed with the songs is beyond me.

The humour which underpinned the original is missing, and when they do attempt it, they miss. Badly. The dialogue was so wooden. Even though it was virtually the same lines we heard 25 years ago, they were delivered so badly.

Most importantly, it felt like a cynical and greasy ploy to make money, and because it knew the title was enough to make says money, it didn't bother trying.

I spoke to them about this movie when they started asking questions about it, I saw the original so many god damn times as a kid myself it was ridiculous. They got excited knowing they were going to see something their Dad saw himself as a kid. They enjoyed this film because they're none the wiser, they didn't grow up with the original like I did.

I'm not a fan of remakes never have been and never will be, they always suck and this ones no exception... animations good and looks very polished, but again it's just the same movie we already know and love, so why remake a perfectly good movie? why fix what isn't broken? the answer is simple... Disney... there you go, there's your answer. Even the voice acting is what i can only describe as half assed, but then again i'd expect nothing less from someone like Seth Rogan doing a Disney film.

I'm so fed up with Disney, Marvel, DC Comics. all their movies are designed to be is just giant cash grabs. Their movies never live up to the hype they generate for that simple reason, especially when it boils down to all these lame superhero movies that are so forgettable you even forget that you saw them in the theater.... it's just about the money now and this is why the film industry sucks so badly these days.

The animals have no equivalent in real life. Maybe they got the hornbill Zazu and Timon right most times. But if you ever saw a real life hyena or lion in the wilderness, you know what I am talking about. Lions don't walk like that, hyenas have a very different body structure and don't really look like whatever they used in the film (dogs?) and Pumba ... just walks like a small poodle.

Then: The filming. They should have consulted Richard Attenborough and his crew on how to film an animal. And even Disney knew how to do it in -The living desert-.

In some scenes, they got it right, but then the music kicked in. Classics like -Circle of Life- in the opening scene were just dull, in other songs like -Can you feel the love tonight- the only thing you feel is Beyoncé in a sound studio, but no connection to the scene.

Finally: Those voices really put me off. Maybe it was the combination with the CGI, but Scar wasn't the badass villain he used to be and even John Oliver - man, I love your show - was somehow remixed in a weird way.",1

Much of the dialogue feels very weak. Some of the lines are terrible. 'Lions! Attack!' made my partner and I look at each other like 'what the heck is this?' I just can't fathom how someone could watch this and compare the experience to the original in terms of a homogenous film.

I fail to see why this was remade other than for money, because there is no sort personality or style of its own, and this remake doesn't offer any new kind of spin on this story, it's basically a shot for shot remake of a film that's already a classic. Why would I ever choose to watch this over the original? It's basically the same movie just without the personality and style of the original. With the photorealistic animals, you can't sympathize with any of them because they don't have any kind of expression, and therefore they can't express emotion. This just goes to show that there was a reason the film was animated in the first place. Also the original was a film that Disney didn't want to make at first, the artists were so passionate about this story that they started to make it anyways out of their own garage and no support from a studio, and yet they still crafted the greatest Disney film of all time. And now that same studio is using their story and milking it for money, because they know how popular it is, which is kind of slimey in my opinion. I can't give it a 0.5/5 because the visuals are spectacular, but none of the changes made to this film were for the better, and nothing of their own was added really. The only difference between this film and the original is that some scenes were shortened and some were drawn out, and all those scenes were terribly executed. So I ask again, when you're remaking something that you know you can't improve, and something that you're not going to change or add your own spin on, then why? Why remake it? It's already a classic, you're just redoing what is already perfect, but you're doing it without the passion, personality, and perfect execution. So, the only reason I can think of is, money.",2

A constant issue throughout the film is that the human emotion of the lines is lost when the realistic looking animal faces are unable to reflect what the dialogue is trying to deliver, purely because if they did over-animate to move like a human face would, then it would look corny and lose the realism.

As an unfortunate side-effect of the dialogue and facial animation not matching up, some of the dialogue feels forced and as though the actors were just not feeling it.

As many others have mentioned, a lot of moments from the original have been cut, some of which were my favourite parts of the original, but also parts that gave important context to inform certain character decisions. As a result of this there are moments where a character seems to jump too quickly to a decision or reaction without enough context to back up why, and these moments lose their immersiveness.

All that seems to be required to have a horror movie made now days. I've said it many times but I'm denounced as a grouch. Modern horror is lieterally ruining decades of work put into the building of a genre which has pulled itself up from the genre known as cheap trash. Long gone are the days of great horror like the exorcist, rosemarys baby, the thing etc. Good storytelling is dead (in all of the genres now days, but expecially in horror) and yet the genere of modern horror is being praised like it's accomplishing something instead of destroying something, like it is doing with good horror. The genre has once more become a joke and degenerated into a place to finger your 15 y.o gf instead of a place to enjoy fantastic and terrifying stories.

I decided to see this one in theaters because unlike the other Conjuring spin-offs, it has a genuinely unique premise (the Warrens' artifacts all become possessed by Annabelle.) I was also intrigued of the prospect of the Warrens coming back. While it's not perfect, this is a pretty solid horror film that should please fans of the franchise.

First-time director Gary Dauberman makes a strong debut behind the camera, managing to craft inventive scares that play around with audience expectations. Even though they are a key part of this franchise, I have never been all that crazy about the loud jump-scares in these films, mainly because I view them as a generally lazy and uninspired way to startle viewers in lieu of creating genuine dread and psychological terror. While the film still has some jump-scares that don't really work, the horror in the film does reach more efficacious and creative heights than that. There are also some moments in the film when the viewer thinks a jump-scare might happen, but it actually does not, which helps balance surprise with suspense during the film's duration. Dauberman uses audience perceptions of space, color and light to create some interesting scares with the Warrens' artifacts. The film's lighting is superb, managing to make the film's aesthetic be both clear and ominous at the same time. While the film's sets are somewhat minimalist, that works to the narrative's advantage. This also makes the horror seem more authentic.

The writing is a cut above many of the ""Conjuring"" films, although some minor plot holes and inconceivable decisions by major characters are still present. The film's score is chilling yet powerful. It's great to see the Warrens back as well, even though they are not exactly the primary characters of this movie. Despite some flaws, this is a good and fairly creative addition to the Conjuring universe. 7/10",7

This was not hot garbage. In fact, the commitment to capturing the time period, the setup, and the actors, all superbly done.

The fault, however, was it got too messy as things took off, with three sub-spooks going on at any given time, and those spooks all playing a game of Calvinball. Calvinball, in case you don't know the game, is a game where the rules just make themselves up as the game goes on; how do you combat a ghost? A flashlight will do for some, a guitar might do for others. This prevents any tension from really grabbing hold since you don't know the stakes, and because the spooks are told through three different moments, you're left wondering what the other character has been doing all this time? (I've come to terms with the fact that the spooks must muffle everything in the room so nobody outside can hear it).

Other than that, wow. I was expecting a... what is this, a midquel? Whatever, I was expecting the 70th installment of this universe (that wasn't directed by Wan himself) to be crap, and it wasn't. Consider me pleased!",

This story does echo familiar with certain thematics/aspects that we've seen in this film universe, with youth being the focal point surrounded by the paranormal phenomenon. The plot does take a little bit of time to develop and maybe spends too much time trying to develop some of the characters before anything really exciting does happen. Once things do start going bump, it does get very fast paced and thoroughly foreboding at times all while staying grounded with the plot.

The overall setting of the Warren house fits the particular story very well and adds nice substance with the artifacts room. The late 60s/early 70s ambience is perfectly done and sets a terrific tone, and the lighting/ camera work is phenomenal as usual for the series. There are many different callbacks to other films in the universe with familiar entities as well as a few new very creepy ones making frightful sporadic appearances. It almost acts as a conjuring universe greatest hits if you will which isn't a bad thing and was actually quite fun. The finale finishes off the film in excellent fashion with with a fantastic culmination of events, and once again I was left wanting more for the series, be it another Annabelle or the upcoming conjuring 3.

Some of the scares also get a little bit cliché at times but they do enough to keep them fresh a majority of the time. Overall this gets the conjuring universe back on track after the last 2 middling to decent films released (The Nun/La LLorona). If you enjoy the series/universe, this is a must see.",8

That doesn't give it justice at all. If it was up to me, I'd give it at least a 7/10. Because that's what it deserves. I've been a big fan of The Conjuring Universe ever since it birthed in 2013 with James Wan's very first masterpiece. Three years later he gave us The Conjuring 2, which in my opinion was just as great - if not better - than the first! The series also expanded into a ""universe"" with various spin-offs. First there was Annabelle (2014), which was decent but not great, then Annabelle Creation (2017) which was EXCELLENT, then there was The Nun (2018) which was okay, but could've been better. Now for Annabelle Comes Home. Everything about this latest installment is brilliant (the plot, setting, atmosphere, actors, characters, direction, and the creative, non-repetitive scares). The idea of Annabelle the doll unleashing evil in The Warrens' artifact room is a brilliant concept, and the film did a wonderful job delivering it. I personally visited The Warrens Occult Museum a few years ago and I thought to myself, ""What if all these creepy artifacts came to life one night?"" It was a notion in the back of my head. I never dreamt it would turn into real movie! Anyway, I must say - this film had me on the edge of my seat. Not only was it suspenseful, creepy, eerie, dark, and diabolical; it introduced me and the franchise to new, horrifying demons! Some include The Ferryman, The Samurai Armor, The Bride (which scared me the most), a werewolf, and a television that shows the future. But that's just a few (isn't one enough?). Gary Dauberman really did a superb job for his directorial debut and he did a great job with the ""jump scare"" restraints. He added a lot of tension and build up when it came to the scary parts. He didn't resort to cheap, uninspired jump scares nor did he have to rely on them to make this movie effectively creepy! I also loved the appearance of Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga as Ed and Lorraine Warren, which was the ""cherry on the top"" of this great spin-off. Even though their appearances were limited, their characters are still as strong as ever and their chemistry continues to shine. Overall, I truly enjoyed Annabelle Comes Home and I think it's THE BEST installment in the 'Annabelle' trilogy. The acting was excellent, the setting and atmosphere was perfect (what could be scarier than The Warren's house in the middle of the night?), and the characters were very likable. The scares were very creative and the film had its sad, comedic, and emotional aspects as well. The various demons were absolutely terrifying, mischievous, and had their own traits, and it was full of suspense and dread. It was like every animal escaping from their cages at the zoo all at the same time, but in a supernatural sense.

I also love how they dedicated the film to Lorraine Warren at the end credits, who sadly passed away back in April. It's a shame she didn't get to see this wonderful installment in a franchise that wouldn't exist if it hadn't been for her and Ed - and their extraordinary career. Annabelle Comes Home is a strong, promising, and well-needed installment which is truly ""the home"" of The Conjuring Universe. I highly recommend it. It's very different from the others, which is a good and refreshing thing all the way! I give it a 10/10 and five stars!

Rest In Peace, Lorraine Warren.",10

Rating 0 /10. Annabelle franchise is a mess with jump scares and cheap tricks borrowed from horror master pieces in the past. James Wan's films are empty and mixture of horror devices that used in successful Western and Eastern horror films in the past. I could not tell what the story was during the screening. Won't regret if you don't see this stuff. Don't waste your money and time for this.

Only jump scares with noisy sound effects and cheap cliches used millions times in J horrors, no plot, no story. This is a spooky house rather than a film or drama. Nothing new, nothing creative. It fully depends on commercial promotions of main stream media and major distributions. Moreover, mixture of monsters without contexts is a chaos. In conclusion, it is a collection of jump scares against the three little girls not a story. The three girls are jump scared to death but still they want to stay in the house? There is no logical explanation for that.

DISLIKES:

Predictability Story Is A Little Fractured The Boyfriend Arc Not As Scary As I Had Hoped A Little Anticlimactic

SUMMARY:

The latest movie in the conjuring universe starts to go back to its roots and polish up things. Annabelle's latest story brings the creepy nature of the movies back to the home and that adds the realistic notion of scares that make fans like me love the series. In the sanctity of the home, one hopes to be harbored from ghosts, but Annabelle's minions prove that not even the familiarity of a home can save you. Nevertheless, the movie manages to bring new types of ghosts and scares that potentially will become movies of their own as the forbidden treasures of the Warrens surface and hint at the secrets in store. Surprisingly, the movie still manages to find some storytelling elements in it as well, but this time through the eyes of a new cast, whose younger members accomplish the goals of terror filled teenagers and adolescents trying to cover up their mistakes. The backstory and character development can be touching, but never quite engulfs the main goal of scaring.

Sadly, the movie suffers from the usual horror trade of imbalance and predictability. The use of foreshadowing, the same tactics for trying to build scares, and the trailers have spoiled much of the suspenseful parts for me and given the rushed component this sometimes blew through the scary parts too quickly to allow the audience to stew in the intensity of the moment. In addition, the movie held too much in terms of story lines, primarily in the number of artifacts they tried to use. Ambitious as it was to brings many guests to the party, Annabelle's focus on all the spirits led a fractured story component that did not quite have the majesty of the origin story we got a few years back. Ghosts aside, the story of the humans with more of a pulse did not come fully together, falling into some simplistic stories that did not quite have the bite I was hoping, especially in regards to the boyfriend arc, which while funny was not entirely necessary to the film. As you can probably guess the movie as a whole not quite that climactic in its finish.

Yet despite all the imbalances, Annabelle's latest trek is about the middle runner for this reviewer. With enough creeps in the realistic setting, one may find themselves afraid of what lies in the dark, becoming quite sensitive to sounds. With new ghosts, some new tricks, and a few new spins on the formula it works for those looking for a good ghost story. Yet, the movie sort of strayed from the story/scare balance of the first one and the characters don't quite have the same drive some of the stronger series installments (Conjuring and Annabelle Creation) has in terms of characters to latch onto or a story to ground it all. Still, it's got enough special effects to garnish a theater run, but only barely. Instead, this one may be better reserved for home, where the setting can help add some horror in itself.

My scores are:

This film decided to go against the grain on some of the scares, and think outside the box, bringing a creative spin into the mix, such as the television screen inside the Warren's locked room.

What ensues, while not the scariest film in the Conjuring-verse, is a fun experience.

This movie is more upbeat than the last two Annabelle movies (including a few funny lines.) Kind of surprising considering that this is written and directed by Gary Dauberman, who wrote the last two films. The ending to the last film is one of the darkest in the Conjuring franchise, so Dauberman's pivot is surprising. However, since this revolves around the house and daughter (Mckenna Grace) of the stars of the main film line, I can see why Dauberman didn't want to do anything that would really rock the boat and affect them in the long run. Also, it'd just be hard to compete with the tone of the last film, which in my opinon was the best.

Understand that when I say this is more upbeat, I'm not saying this film isn't scary. It just has more of a popcorn/funhouse horror feel. Ever since the Warrens' collection of possessed and cursed objects was introduced, I think everyone has been itching to explore them more, and you definitely get your payoff. There are some pretty creepy ghosts in here, including one inventive being that isn't in the commercials and I won't spoil.

I do wish the other ghosts were given more to do. Annabelle still bears the load. I just wanted to see the ghosts have some more physicality and violence. (Yes, the samurai armor from the earlier films is still in the collection. No, it doesn't unsheathe it's sword. I know, right?!) Also, there is one ghost who mostly tangles with Michael Cimino's character that is mostly done using computer animation and doesn't work as well as the other more practical-looking monsters.

Considering that this is a first time director, this looks pretty nice. There are some nicely shot scares. They don't compete with the best of the series, but they work. A lot of thought must have went into the set design. This really looks like it takes place during the seventies.

The three main leads are pretty likable, especially Katie Sarife's character. At first you worry that she's the stereotypical party friend to the lead who makes bad decisions. Yeah, she kind of does that latter part, but her character goes in a way that is unexpected and fleshes her out.

If you were looking forward to seeing Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) and Ed Warren (Patrick WIlson), be prepared that they really aren't in this that much.

I'd rank this above Annabelle 1, The Nun, and La Llorona, and below the Conjurings and Annabelle Creation. This isn't the scariest or most technically proficient film in the franchise, but this doesn't miss by that much. If you're just looking for something visually interesting that is just trying to entertain, then I recommend this.",8

This movie had some really nice camera shots , which was super nice to see. So I really loved that. After all I'm not too dissapointed about this one although I think Creation was a little better.

Even my partner who loves horror films and followed all the conjuring franchise also barely able to watch some of scenes. It's just get horrific on certain scenes. Don't mention me, some parts really got me shocked.

Be prepare for jump scare moment. It's a lot of them by the way. All thanks to the camera work. Its really really good. The director did a great job on it. He deserved a credit for that!

I think most of you who watched the trailer already knew that this movie is not just about the scary doll. It's the new untold stories/haunted items that make the film more solid. Would love to watch more detail about them. Maybe a solo film like The Nun does. Just hopefully they don't screw it up.

I personally think so far its the best Annabelle film. Even more exciting than Creation. All the actresses also really did well in the film. No doubt about them. It is worth watching? Yes, even for those you don't love horror movie. But you ain't gonna like it ;-)",9

Although there are a fair share of average at best films or even clunkers (even when trying to take them for what they are or intend to be), there are also an equal fair share of good horror films as well as classics, which won't be named in order to be fair.

Really enjoyed the two 'The Conjuring' films for the same reasons to each other, that they were well-made, well-crafted, suspenseful, entertaining and had genuine shocks. 'Annabelle' is inevitably compared to them, but to me it doesn't compare favourably and could have been much better. Its prequel 'Annabelle: Creation', although far from perfect or great with some of the same mistakes being made, again to me fared better, though again not close to the quality of 'The Conjuring' films. 'The Nun' meanwhile was a mediocre disappointment. Put 'Annabelle Comes Home' in the middle and personally found it a difficult film to rate and review, though it will be easier for others.

'Annabelle Comes Home' looks good. There is a great Gothic atmosphere, lush and darkly atmospheric production design and stylish photography. The supernatural effects are surprisingly excellent too. The music is haunting and the direction brings a genuine eeriness and mysteriousness in places. There are parts that are suitably uneasy and eerie once 'Annabelle Comes Home' gets going.

The pace, again once the film gets into gear, it has been said that the mute vision in the television is the scariest part and do have to agree with this. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga do good jobs, though take a backseat to the younger cast. Was worried that this would not work, but the younger cast carry the film quite well and don't bore and annoy as feared.

However, the story is near-non existent with few surprises and can get very silly. Especially towards the end. Although there are moments of scares and suspense, there are not enough of either and could have done with more build up that would have made them less predictable.

Did feel that the pacing was still very flawed. 'Annabelle Comes Home' takes too long to get going and then the climactic parts feel very rushed. The ending is one of the film's biggest issues, as well as being rushed it was very anti-climactic and bordered on plain ridiculous, as well as illogical. The dialogue is no improvement too, very awkward-sounding and banal, doing little with developing rather clichéd characters.

Summarising, difficult to rate and review. Watchable but never rises above borderline between average and decent. 5/10",5

I was tired of watching the same pattern being followed in the Annabelle franchise and this one brings us something fresh to view. I had terrible experience with the first Annabelle movie and I'm not a big fan of Annabelle Creation because of its overuse of CGI. And so I was expecting nothing much for Annabelle Comes Home. But oh boy I was surprised with how the movie went on.

The first half was okayish with all the introduction of the characters. Which was done in a very well manner I suppose. And they were believable too. The second half takes you on a crazy rollercoaster. It reminds me what made the first conjuring movie special. The pacing of the movie was very well done too. Every stupid action taken by the character had a logical and reasonable reason to do so. That's what I liked about this movie. It's not just plain stupid. When you feel like the chaotic scenes are over they hit you with some great emotional scenes which many horror directors of this generation seems to forget the necessity or the impact it has on the audience.

I left the theatre with a smile on my face. And not many horror movies can do that. The director Gary Dauberman knows how to do it. Go watch it in the theatres and you won't regret it.

There'll be a lot of creative creepy scenes, not only with Annabelle, but with different items (and creatures) almost every of them can be used for the whole separate film. Instead, Dauberman generously placing cursed boxes, hellhounds, ghosts and some more supernatural stuff around the house, slowly builds tension and knows when to ease it with a one-liner jokes. This is pure story-driven film, with minimal using of jumpscares and CGI, but maximum reliance on lights and shadows, dark corners on the background and simple, but likable characters.

They spent a really long time focusing on the three characters that this haunting was going to happen to and in the end just made it really boring. People could argue that it's so we will care about them when everything goes down but it doesn't work or at least in my case. This also leads to a super quick ending that just wraps up awkwardly. Also, I can't hate on the film too much because it is Gary Dauberman's first time directing but I think he overkilled it with the whole tension build up during some scenes. Because there was a long build up to something it just lost its scare factor in some cases. The ending felt like three completely different films just mixed into one as if this one wouldn't make enough to make the other two. This isn't that big of a deal but to the person in charge of making the house match up with the others failed. The clothes match up it's just the house set that didn't match up. But like I said this isn't that big of a deal but it still just bugs me because I already know what the house looks like. Will give the movie props for having a great atmosphere set up though because in every scene you knew what kind of scene it was going to be. But it also loses marks for not having bright enough lighting to see what was going on in certain scenes. Everybody did decent jobs in the acting department. I thought I wasn't going to like Mckenna Grace as Judy but in the end, she did an amazing job. I also loved seeing Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga back as Ed and Lorraine.
