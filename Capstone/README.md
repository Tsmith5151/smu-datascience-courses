#### RShiny Application for Evaluating Machine Learning Models with Various Data Complexities
- Analytical tool built with the RShiny framework that enables users to rapidly generate synthetic datasets with various characteristics and complexities. Random Forest and Logistic Regression are to two models currently supported for evaluating relative performance for given datasets. Performance metrics include true/false positive rates, accuracy, roc, f1 scores, precision, and recall. This work was in conjunction with the SMU's Data Science Capstone Project.
